            "description": "Subscribe to the DUST Newsletter: http://eepurl.com/gnTIbD\n\nThe entire world has been rapidly overgrown by a dense jungle. Two survivors of a downed reconnaissance ship are about to discover that mother nature has a powerful new ally. \n\nSatori [Awakening] by Adam K Batchelor\n\nSubscribe to DUST on YouTube: http://bit.ly/2aqc5vh\n\n#DUST #scifi #satoriawakening \n\nwww.adamkbatchelor.com \nwww.twotwentytwomusic.co.uk  \n\nFull Synopsis \n\nAfter harnessing the power of ‘artificial intelligence’ to reverse the environmental damage humans have inflicted on the planet, the AI spirals out of our control, covering the entire land surface in a dense jungle terrain. Now, only a fraction of the population remains, as the majority struggle to survive in this new natural world. A group of scientists, technicians and military personnel stay sheltered from the dangerous jungle surroundings in a top secret, underground R&D facility. But as they begin to search for survivors they discover a mysterious new force that is now firmly in control. Upon venturing deeper, they become exposed to the strict rules and customs that protect the new ecosystem, above all else. \n\nDirector's Statement \n\nAfter researching the ongoing developments in the climate change debate and watching it become front and centre in mainstream news, Satori took shape in my mind as a large-scale, multi-faceted world with multiple storylines and characters. So really, the first challenge was to pull together a short story from the canvas which retained the original themes and maintained the feeling of a larger concept. I guess you could say that this short film is a proof of concept for the real story of Satori.\n\nWithin the narrative, my aim was to explore the human relationship with the planet alongside new emerging technologies; as well as gender stereotypes and social norms. I find it hugely interesting how quick life could change and how dramatic the impact could be, as large-scale paradigm shifts inevitably transform the way us humans view our existence. \n\nThe female heroine in this film is a comment on the need to maintain a ‘feminine’ or balanced approach to a crisis. She isn’t the quintessential twenty-something ‘action (wo)man’ with exaggerated physical strength in a female casting. Instead she is a relatable profile that maintains true strength and honest characteristics; including instinct, intuition, compassion and self-awareness. All of which are the essential leadership attributes needed at this time. \n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

Seven's character goes through the trauma of gas-lighting, but on a public scale. Reality television specifically exploits and bends the truth in this way. We just extrapolated how that would play out in the future when bots like Siri and Alexa become nearly indistinguishable from humans. Wouldn't there be a game show where contestants have to figure out who among them is the machine?  The fascinating part is how open we are to untested technology, especially when it’s entertaining. That can be a good thing for technologists. From firsthand experience building @artieapp (check it out on Instagram) we know that sometimes a glitch can become a feature. There is a fine line though. In the film it’s not clear whether the host is following a script, or if he’s manipulating the contestants of his own volition. Are we just a glitch away from disaster? Or are we a glitch away from a great discovery? That’s the idea behind our feature script, which examines the characters lives in the aftermath of the game show. \n\nDirectors' Links:\nhttps://www.puduproductions.com\nhttps://astrolab.studio/\nhttps://objexunlimited.com\nhttps://itsgotstealth.com\n\nDUST: Binge-watchable Sci-fi\nDUST is the first multi-platform destination for binge watchable sci-fi.

But it can still hold an atom together.\n\n\"Quantum Love\" by Matic Grgic\n\nDirector's Statement:\n\"I imagined the quantum world as an infinitely miniaturized version of our own world. But since life in the realm of subatomic particles must have existed for almost as long as universe itself, or at least, way longer than our own, then it must be old. So, I decided to make the abstract quantum world a bit more real and mix it with some old-looking, gritty and decaying cyber technology – which is still way beyond our reach and understanding. Sort of like a quantum cyberpunk world.\" - Matic Grgic\n\nDirector's Links:\nhttp://www.maticgrgic.com\nhttp://vimeo.com/268394198\nhttp://vimeo.com/268403362\n\r\n#SciFi #DUST #ShortFilm\nDUST: Binge-watchable Sci-fi\r\nDUST is the first multi-platform destination for binge watchable sci-fi.

I was introduced to the year-round sunlight in LA, celebrities, Instagram influencers, and most importantly, Hollywood. As a girl in a big city, I was naïve, eager to make new friends, and go on dates. I quickly picked up on all the “hip” fashion, make-up trends, and downloaded Instagram, Tinder, and Bumble on my phone. In no time, my feed was only filled with attractive models. There is a widespread desirable “type” with everyone having the same perfect, uniform body proportions. Desperate to fit into the box of perfection, I dyed my hair, started getting routine lash extensions, followed diet plans, and became a Photoshop expert. Soon, my social media photos looked like they could be Vogue covers. I had developed “goggles” and my eyes were conditioned to look for certain types of people- beautiful, successful, and fun. I went on numerous dates; however, each date felt ingenuine, superficial, and draining. I was exhausted of maintaining my “perfect” façade and became depressed. In the end, all my efforts made me lonelier, and even more single. This was the story seed for my UCLA thesis film. When film school got busy, I picked myself out of the void and focused on my goals. This helped me set my priorities to finally focus on myself and my passions, rather than the pressures of society. I strengthened my relationships with my existing friends and lived a healthier lifestyle, which enhanced my self-esteem and confidence. I look back at my social media addiction days and appreciate the trauma that helped me grow into the person I am today. When the time came to create my film, I channeled that trauma into my dystopian science-fiction film, “Cupid’s Paradise”. The film is a hyperbole of social apps. It reflects myself and my personal experiences getting lost in the current digital space filled with superficial criteria such as likes, beauty standards, and digital first-impressions. The story emphasizes the pressure to look, behave, and think a certain way. Cupid’s Paradise is loud and absurd, poking fun at everything that’s acceptable in society today and bringing out the ugly sides to finding love in a superficial, digital world.\" - Ivy Liao\n\nDirector's Links:\nhttp://www.ivyliao.com\nhttp://www.ivyimages.co \nhttp://www.cupidsparadise.com\n\n#SciFi #DUST #ShortFilm \nDUST is the first multi-platform destination for binge watchable sci-fi.

After weeks of research, a malfunction during the return launch forces Lilian to choose between survival and completing the mission. \n\n\"Nine Minutes\" by Ernie Gilbert\n\nSubscribe to the DUST Newsletter: https://bit.ly/signal_newsletter\n\n#DUST #scifi #shortfilm\n\nDirector's Statement:\n\"I wrote and directed Nine Minutes from a simple idea I had. What if you knew you had only a handful of minutes left. What would you do? What would you reflect on? From there, I knew I wanted a grand scale and scope but to tell an intimate story. I landed on a solo astronaut explorer, Lilian. Intense and enthusiastic about her work. Stubborn to the end. She has to choose between her work and her own survival. The short developed into an allegory for my own feelings about leaving NC to move to LA to follow my career ambitions and what that means leaving behind. What relationships I lost, what time apart from family, and ultimately what that made me feel.\" - Ernie Gilbert\n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

            "description": "Two pilots fight a war in the distant future in their fighter-bomber spacecraft. But is the true enemy their alien opponent...or each other? \n\n\"Sky Fighter\" by Lukas Kendall\n\nSubscribe to the DUST Newsletter: https://bit.ly/signal_newsletter\n\n#DUST #scifi #shortfilm\n\nMore About Sky Fighter:\nIn the 26th century: humankind fights a war in space against an unstoppable alien adversary. A pilot, John, awakens on the deck of his two-man fighter-bomber spaceship—with no memory how he got there. His copilot, Mo, tells him he was hacked (via his cybernetics) by the aliens, and she tried to save him...yet evidence on the ship points to HER being the one possessed by the enemy. Should he trust her...or the little memory he regains?\n\nDirector's Statement:\n\"This is a take on space warfare I've always loved (Star Wars, Robotech, Battlestar Galactica) with a Twilight Zone/Black Mirror/Memento twist. (Robotech fans: you'll recognize the voice on the radio.) Hopefully there's something to make you feel, make you think—and give you some candy for your eyes and ears. It's bread-and-butter suspense storytelling, grounding the fantastic in relatable human behavior. There is a moral to the story...but I can't give it away without ruining the ending.\" —Lukas Kendall \n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

She's consumed by helping depressed and unhappy people, even though, she's the one who needs the help. She copes with the situation by hiding the problems and locking herself in a bubble, which only traps her in a cycle of consumerism. An introspective journey into her psychology will lead us into a battle with her own darkness and fears.\n\nConnect with Vicente Manzano:\nWebsite: https://www.bychovy.com\nFollow Vicente Manzano on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/vicentemanzanop/\n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

The rise and fall of their company, the Mundi Corporation, is told over the course of five episodes.\n\n\"The Leap\" by Karel van Bellingen\nIn 2069, New Earth is declared open for civilian migration, a decade after its discovery. As tales of wonder and opportunity reach the Old World, taking ‘the leap’ becomes the dream of millions. Unable to afford the journey, many of the less fortunate risk their lives being smuggled aboard cargo ships. The inter-planetary Migration Administration, or IPMA, deals with human trafficking on a biblical scale.\n\nFifteen years later, Jacob Reiss, a disillusioned IPMA veteran, has a fateful encounter with a young cartel prostitute. A meeting that forces him to confront a dark chapter from his past in order to save them both from a bleak future in one final, violent shot at redemption.\n\nSubscribe to the DUST Newsletter: https://bit.ly/signal_newsletter\n\n#DUST #scifi #shortfilm\n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

            "description": "The powerful elite lets a struggling musician fight for survival using his talent. One day he finds a prototype of a new kind of AI. It can help him become a Mozart of his time, but he has to risk everything.\n\n\"Secret Chord\" by Karl Thyselius\n\nSubscribe to the DUST Newsletter: https://bit.ly/signal_newsletter\n\n#DUST #scifi #shortfilm\n\nMore About Secret Chord:\nThe AI revolution was supposed to set us free. But a powerful elite used it to seize total control. Most people couldn't contribute to society. They were deemed expendable and disappeared. But the elite needed entertainment, so they kept the poets, the authors, the musicians. They kept the struggling musician Max. He has to fight for survival using his talent. One day he finds a prototype of a new kind of AI. It can help hime to become a Mozart of his time, but he has to risk everything.\n\nDirector's Statement:\nI’m making a cinematic science fiction anthology television series consisting of of 10 short films, in the style of Black Mirror and Love, Death and Robots. It examines modern society, particularly with regard to the unanticipated consequences of new technologies. Episodes are standalone, usually set in an alternative present or the near future, often with a dark tone, though some are more experimental and lighter. The reason I'm making films is I want to talk about subjects that are important to me. Populism, privacy, the dangers of AI all come together in this short. We decide what kind of world we want to live in, and movies are very important because they can show us what different scenarios will lead to.\n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

Earth, existence, and consciousness; all the design of a hyper intelligent race of aliens known as the Thesquardorians. On December the 31st, 1974, the Thesquardorians decided the simulation had run its course. This is an absurdist comedy set in a computer lab in the 1970s. Two computer technicians dredging through their graveyard shift on New Year’s Eve stumble upon the final digit of pi which sends their entire existence spiraling out of control as they come to terms with the fact that it was all a sophisticated computer simulation.\n\n\"Frances and Yuri Ring in the New Year\" by Artin Aroutounians\n\nSubscribe to the DUST Newsletter: https://bit.ly/signal_newsletter\n\n#DUST #scifi #shortfilm\n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

            "description": "When Dan Levy goes to get his snoring, pregnant wife a glass of water, he meets an alternate version of himself who has an offer this Dan might not be able to refuse.\n\n\"The Universe of Scotch and Häagen Dazs\" by Jonathan Ross\n\nSubscribe to the DUST Newsletter: https://bit.ly/signal_newsletter\n\n#DUST #scifi #shortfilm\n\nMore About The Universe of Scotch and Häagen Dazs: \nIn the middle of the night, Dan Levy is awakened by his snoring, very-pregnant wife who stirs to ask for a glass of water. As Dan returns from the kitchen, he's met by a carbon copy of himself, fitted in a nice suit and offering an amazing opportunity. Suit Dan is from another universe in the multiverse, one in which he travels from universe to universe to sell different Dan Levys on swapping lives for a time. Selling options as far ranging as “the universe where you become a matador” to the “universe where you do a lot of weeding”, Suit Dan Levy convinces Dan to go for it. Dan insists he must leave right now. About to zap into another universe, Dan asks Suit Dan to journey to a universe where he’d be taller. Suit Dan explains that you can’t switch with a universe dependent on other people’s decisions (Tall Dans live in the universes where Mom breastfed them). At the same time, Dan hears his wife snoring again. He realizes that he can choose to be happy in his own universe, bids goodbye to Suit Dan with the promise to keep in touch, and goes back to sleep next to his pregnant wife. \n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

            "description": "Starring Sunita Mani from Netflix's hit series \"GLOW\" and USA's \"Mr. Robot\" - watch the award winning sci-fi short film now.\n\n\"Regulation\" by Ryan Patch\n\nSubscribe to the DUST Newsletter: https://bit.ly/signal_newsletter\n\n#DUST #scifi #shortfilm\n\nMore About Regulation:\nEvery child has the right to be happy. By law.\nIn the near future, a young social worker (Sunita Mani, “Glow” & \"Mr. Robot\") travels to a small community to administer behavior-modifying \"patches\" that guarantee happiness for the wearers. She must decide what to do when a precocious girl (Audrey Bennett, “Frozen on Broadway”) refuses to accept the patch.\n\nDirector's Statement:\nAs someone with a close family member who struggles with severe mental health issues, the way that we understand and help people with these challenges is always on my mind. So, when I stumbled across a Harvard bioethicist’s blog about the idea of always-on, perfectly-administered drip dosage of antidepressants, an entire world began to form in my head where this technology was a part of everyday life.\n\nI started to think about what this could do for people in our country, but also what it would do for our country’s culture. Who would use it? How would we handle this as a society? And also, how might the government address the disparity in privilege this technology would create between children who grew up with the wealth to be “happy” and those who did not? This lead me to think about what the government’s responsibility is to “level the playing field” in health and where can human freedom be factored into these decisions?\n\nThere are a number of contentious issues in our country that, at their core, are discussions that pit something that might make society “better” against a loss of individual freedoms. We all agree it’s good the government removes citizens’ “freedom” to drive on the left side of the road in return for having safe roads. But where should the line be between giving up a freedom that makes “society” a better place, and allowing citizens to retain important autonomy? Many of us disagree about where this line might be for different issues like guns, education, or medical care, but I hope that this film serves as a starting place to discuss these issues, and for each side to empathize with the values and motivations of the other.\n\nThis film was made possible by a grant from The Moving Picture Institute.\n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

            "description": "A man tries to do his laundry, but comes across an unexpected obstacle at the laundrette. DAY ONE is a cautionary tale on automation and artificial intelligence. This film was completed in 48 hours, from writing to post-production, in the SCI-FI London film festival.\n\n\"Day One\" by Mahmut Akay\n\nSubscribe to the DUST Newsletter: https://bit.ly/signal_newsletter\n\n#DUST #scifi #shortfilm\n\nMore About Day One:\nJoe enters a laundrette, loads his laundry and pays into the slot machine. The slot machine malfunctions, leaving his clothes locked inside the washing machine. When an assistant approaches him for help, Joe is dismayed to find a robot has replaced a human worker. The robot unlocks the washing machine but Joe demands his money back. Joe becomes irate as the robot continuously misinterprets Joe's demands. Joe loses his nerve and threatens the robot, which sets off an alarm. Joe runs out of the laundrette. The robot's demeanour suddenly becomes more human-like. He pats the slot machine to release Joe's change, revealing him to be an intelligent and machiavellian robot that outsmarted the human.\n\nThis film was made for the SCI-FI London 48 hour film competition where they require you to make a film based off a film title, line of dialogue and action/prop, within 2 days. Being at the mercy of the 48 hours was ironically a liberating experience that allowed us to ride a creative wave from conception all the way to post-production. The dynamics to making a short film with such a quick turnaround force you into a creative flow with the whole cast/crew synergising to make it happen as opposed to the normal, slower production process.The 48 hours were ticking. Finding a laundrette and building the robot head proved to be a logistical challenge. After scouting many different laundrettes and struggling to find the perfect one, we had almost given up until we had a serendipitous encounters with another film crew also scouting for laundrettes. The location manager of that crew recommended one for us, which we fell in love with and thankfully gained permission to shoot there after hours. The owner of the laundrette also happened to be a set designer, which meant he was very aware and understanding of what a film shoot entails. The caveat was that we only had 5 hours to shoot the whole short.The robot head was also being constructed at the same time. Once our prop maker figured a welding helmet would work as the basis, everything else fell into place with bringing the head to life.\n\nDirector's Statement:\nDay One is a cautionary tale on the dangers of artificial intelligence outsmarting us in the future. While the intention isn’t to criticize automation, we wanted to raise awareness on the impact it can have on society in the future. We’ve all been in a situation where we want to bypass the automated customer services and speak directly to a human on the phone or when a virtual assistant like Siri misinterprets us. The short film is a heightened reality of those situations and functions as a fable to warn us of where we could end up if we aren’t careful with the insidious implementation of artificial intelligence into society.\n\nConnect with Mahmut Akay:\nWebsite: www.mahmutakay.com\nFollow Mahmut Akay on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/mahmutakay \nFollow Mahmut Akay on Vimeo: https://vimeo.com/user952596\n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

            "description": "A genius hacker and his dog help an enigmatic young woman to free the remaining test subjects of a black ops ESP test lab.\n\n\"PostHuman\" by Cole Drumb\n\n#DUST #scifi #shortfilm\n\nMore About PostHuman:\nPostHuman follows Terrence and his dog Nine in an adrenalized future of espionage, super science, and assassins. Terrence agrees to help Kali, an escaped test subject from a black ops ESP test lab, in her effort to free the last surviving imprisoned test subject. The assault on the lab is fast paced and intense as Terrence uses every hacker trick he knows to destroy the lab’s defenses and give Kali the opportunity to free her tortured lab mate, Benjamin. Gritty, hyperstylized, and dripping with intense images, PostHuman is NSFW, for children, or adults with no sense of adventure.\n\nFilmmaker's Statement:\nI am a geek. There is more to be sure but that identification may well be enough. I cannot say I am smart enough to be a nerd but I can say I am passionate enough to be a geek. The world of PostHuman came in an explosion of thought more than fifteen years ago, influenced by a wide variety of artists in many mediums. The work of realizing that world took another five years to construct, starting with script and sketches followed by storyboards (many many glorious boards) and later the hunt and hire for a staggeringly talented crew. A film professor once told me that film production equaled the long degeneration of a great idea and with PostHuman I want to believe I have put a burning match to that parasitic statement and killed it in a jar of alcohol.\n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

While trying to construct a machine capable of providing the world’s most accurate personality quiz, three computer engineers in a small garage in Silicon Valley accidentally stumble upon a full-fledged artificial intelligence that can read souls. The rise and fall of their company, the Mundi Corporation, is told over the course of five episodes.\n\n\"Who You Are\" by Joel Jay Blacker & Sam Roots // Episode 5 of 5\n\nSubscribe to the DUST Newsletter: https://bit.ly/signal_newsletter\n\n#DUST #scifi #shortfilm\n\nDirector's Statement:\nWith the constant talk and threat of the future and AI, we thought it would be funny to take an opposite approach to an AI story. We're all so confident that the end is nigh when talking about technology, but what if an AI was just as depressed and cynical as us? The show is about three creators who have built what they believe to be the future of tech.

While trying to construct a machine capable of providing the world’s most accurate personality quiz, three computer engineers in a small garage in Silicon Valley accidentally stumble upon a full-fledged artificial intelligence that can read souls. The rise and fall of their company, the Mundi Corporation, is told over the course of five episodes.\n\n\"Who You Are\" by Joel Jay Blacker and Sam Roots // Episode 1 of 5\n\nSubscribe to the DUST Newsletter: https://bit.ly/signal_newsletter\n\n#DUST #scifi #shortfilm\n\nDirector's Statement:\nWith the constant talk and threat of the future and AI, we thought it would be funny to take an opposite approach to an AI story. We're all so confident that the end is nigh when talking about technology, but what if an AI was just as depressed and cynical as us? The show is about three creators who have built what they believe to be the future of tech. Instead, it's just another headache. \n\nConnect with Joel Jay Blacker:\nWebsite: https://Joelblacker.com\n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

Many trillions of years ago, a small maintenance robot was jettisoned into outer space. Now, as it drifts beyond the cosmos and out into the interstellar void, it becomes the only being to witness to the collapse of the known universe.\n\n\"The Long Slow Flight of the Ashbot\" by Colin West // Part III of The Robot Scriptures\n\nSubscribe to the DUST Newsletter: https://bit.ly/signal_newsletter\n\n#DUST #scifi #shortfilm\n\nDirector's Statement:\nThe Long Slow Flight of the Ashbot is part III of The Robot Scriptures -- a three-part short film series about the origin, evolution, and exodus of artificial intelligence. The idea for the series first came about when I was working for a very large tech company that was constantly considering the impending robot singularity. I began thinking about life from their point of view. The Robots that is. I thought, what happens when human beings die out and all that are left are the robot species? At that point, what would the robots know about their origin? Their creators? Their God? My hunch is, they would be asking many of the same questions we do about our own human origin -- some leaning toward spiritual answers, some scientific, some ridiculous. This film intends to explore these questions.\n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

            "description": "This inclusive version of \"How To Be Human\" includes an audio description for individuals with visual impairment. If you were forced to flee your own war-ridden country, would you sacrifice what makes you human to survive? \"How to be Human\" by Bruno Centofanti\n\nSubscribe to the DUST Newsletter: https://bit.ly/signal_newsletter\n\n#DUST #scifi #shortfilm\n\nMore About How To Be Human:\nIn a world where artificial intelligence has dismantled the human contribution, Adelphe (Scottish BAFTA-winner, Sophie Kennedy Clarke) has to help her sister Kimi (Louise Salter) to lose her humanity. Moreover, Kimi has to forget how to be human in order to fully disguise herself as an AI and survive in the only liveable place, “Cold City”. As they embark on this crossing, Kimi is forced to confront situations that put her sister, and her manufactured intuition, to the test. We learn through this unique perspective as we watch the two sisters pursue safety and refuge, made possible by the help and support of Maria (Les Misérables, Tony-award winner, Frances Ruffelle). In a world where the migration of displaced people is so present, this story reminds us of how being born in the right place and the right time can so often lead us to take our freedom and basic rights for granted. \n\nFilmmaker's Statement:\nAs a highly passionate director and producer, I love to discover and tell stories. Storytelling is very much what drives me. My niche is in finding the surprising truth in human stories, to inspire people and to put them in touch with their humanity. I’ve been privileged as a film director to work with a wide and diverse spectrum of artists and subjects. I’ve traveled the world, freely immersing myself in societies, breaking barriers of class and culture. Being the grandson of a Jewish immigrant who buried her past in order to survive and only discovering my own roots later in life, the idea of telling the story of a young girl who needs to hide her identity in order to survive, feels personal, powerful and inspiring to me. \n\nHow to be Human is a visually compelling story that has many parallels with society today. It shows a dystopian society where humans have been superseded by Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the survival of human identity relies on the dangerous crossing to an uncertain future. The Crossing is a pilgrimage where Kimi is forced to leave behind her memories, her experiences and her identity; in the hope that on the other side, things will be better. Will the crossing save her? Has Human freedom and love been lost forever? This is a vivid and relevant story for our times. In a world where the migration of displaced people is so present, this story reminds us of how being born in the right place and the right time can so often lead us to take our freedom and basic rights for granted. Intimate, poetic and life affirming, this isn’t just an incredible story of determination against all odds; we are exploring the precious and delicate nature of human existence and the values that make us who we are. Our aim is to provoke in the audience a great empathy for others and help to dissolve the refugee stigma.\n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

In a world where the migration of displaced people is so present, this story reminds us of how being born in the right place and the right time can so often lead us to take our freedom and basic rights for granted. Intimate, poetic and life affirming, this isn’t just an incredible story of determination against all odds; we are exploring the precious and delicate nature of human existence and the values that make us who we are. Our aim is to provoke in the audience a great empathy for others and help to dissolve the refugee stigma. \n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

            "description": "After a painful breakup, Aaron purchases a life-size doll to serve as a replacement for the companionship he has lost. This simple solution to his relationship problem is complicated by a visit from his ex.\n\n\"Custom Order\" by Will Lowell\n\nSubscribe to the DUST Newsletter: https://bit.ly/signal_newsletter\n\n#DUST #scifi #shortfilm\n\nFilmmaker's Statement:\nI've been watching so much great content that speculates about the bizarre future we may soon live in. As much as I love engaging with these ideas, I think we often lose sight of what a weird time we're already experiencing. We're so busy looking toward the future that we forget we're living in it. I wanted to make a film about technology, but set it in a world that is so ordinary and familiar that it's almost banal. The inspiration for this project came from a conversation I had with Sophie Kargman (who stars in and produced Custom Order) after we both read about a man who had created an automated doll to identically resemble Scarlett Johansson. Aside from being fascinated that this technology even exists, we were both compelled to explore the ethical questions raised. What rights does she have regarding her own likeness? Can genuine human intimacy be replicated by technology, and at what cost? In a world of VR and deepfakes, these questions are increasingly pressing and unsettling. Aside from the technology driven themes explored in the short, I am also interested in the burden that men's choices and conditioning often place on the women around them. As much as this is a short about Aaron's choice to remove himself from the messiness of real intimacy, my goal was to subtly draw attention away from Aaron toward the consequences of his actions for both Nicole and her doppelganger doll. \n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

            "description": "In this sci-fi retelling of Edgar Allan Poe's \"The Tell-Tale Heart,\" a pair of astronauts work on a small space station orbiting a distant planet. As the mysterious narrator attempts to convince himself of his sanity while describing his brutal act of murder, he becomes haunted by a thunderous heartbeat that could only come from the far reaches of space.\n\n\"Orbit\" by Nicholas Camp and Don Thiel III\nStory based on \"The Tell-Tale Heart\" by Edgar Allan Poe\n\nSubscribe to the DUST Newsletter: https://bit.ly/signal_newsletter\n\n#DUST #scifi #shortfilm\n\nMore About Orbit: \nAn old astronaut and his young trainee are studying a mysterious planet in deep space. The trainee is distressed over the old man’s deformed eye, and it turns into a deadly obsession. The trainee murders the old man, and believes he is free of the eye’s ghastly power. \n\nWhile presenting a spotless crime scene to the investigators, the trainee descends to an abyss of fear and paranoia. He hears the sound of a heartbeat coming from beneath the floor, and it begins to grow louder...\n\nFilmmaker's Statement:\nNicholas had always wanted to make a movie taking place on a space station orbiting a mysterious planet, and Don wanted to follow up his award-winning short, “The Raven,” with another Edgar Allan Poe story. As they discussed their next projects, it did not take long to realize that setting “The Tell-Tale Heart” on a small space station could add to the isolated, eerie tone of the story, and help motivate the lead character’s descent into madness. \n\nNarrative \"Making Of\":\nWe were determined to create a tangible, realistic feel that is inspired by the movies we watched growing up. All of the interior and exterior sets are real, hand-crafted models, and the planet and space elements were made with mixtures of thick, colorful liquids. \n\nTragically, this is the final project released featuring actor Jacob Witkin as he passed away shortly after production wrapped. Jacob had an incredible presence on set, and people from our cast and crew often pulled us aside to mention how enjoyable it was to work with him. Jacob had a great sense of humor, and he was an incredible actor. His scope of work illustrates his interest in all kinds of stories and characters, and we are so lucky to have him in “Orbit.”\n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

            "description": "In a dystopian world a new form of A.I. weaponry has been created. All these drone bots need is a profile: age, sex, fitness, uniform, and ethnicity. Nuclear is obsolete. Take out your entire enemy virtually risk free. Just characterize him, release the swarm, and rest easy.\n\n\"Slaughterbots\" directed by Stewart Sugg\n\nSubscribe to the DUST Newsletter: https://bit.ly/signal_newsletter\n\n#DUST #scifi #shortfilm\n\nMore About Slaughterbots: \nThe 7 minute film opens with a Silicon Valley CEO-type delivering a product presentation to a live audience a la Steve Jobs. The presentation seems innocuous enough at first—the presenter seems to be unveiling some new drone technology—but takes a dark turn when he demonstrates how these autonomous drones can slaughter humans like cattle by delivering “a shaped explosive” to the skull.The audience eats it up, clapping and laughing along with the CEO as if they hadn’t witnessed anything more dangerous than the unveiling of the iPhone X. The CEO goes further, showing videos of the tiny killer drone in action. “Let’s watch what happens when the weapons make the decisions,” the CEO says, as the bot executes a number of people on the massive screen behind him. “Now trust me, these are all bad guys.” What follows is a deeply unsettling portrait of a dystopian world where these small weaponised drones use their onboard technologies—“cameras like you use for your social media apps, facial recognition like you have on your phones!”—to make autonomous decisions about who lives and who dies.\n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

Tune in at 7pm PST for the live chat experience.\n\nThis week's lineup includes:\n\nCALEB by Amanda Mesaikos, Susanne Aichele | 0:30\nTo contend with the bullies at school, 9-year-old Caleb decides to 3D print himself. Back home there's confusion, discord and reshuffled schedules...But maybe this is just what his family needs? With humor at its heart, CALEB is a fundamentally human story about family dynamics and the inevitability of moral dilemmas in the face of advancing technology.\nStandalone link: https://youtu.be/t8BMGRWHHaE\n\nGOLDEN SHOT by Gökalp Gönen | 15:12\nRusty machines living in their small houses, imagine that the sun will come and take them to the sky someday. A small light, keeps them alive and dreaming. But one of the machines wants to see the sun itself and he has a plan for that.\nStandalone Link: https://youtu.be/pnw3tFSeQqg\n\nSEAM by Elan Dassani, Rajeev Dassani | 24:12\nIn the not-too-distant future, a tenuous peace between humans and remarkably humanlike “machines”—some don’t even know they’re not real—is tested when synthetics begin spontaneously exploding. A military-led search for these unwitting suicide bombers begins, sending a terrified machine woman and her human partner on the run.\nStandalone Link: https://youtu.be/vDjcWlCT8rg\n\nSOULS OF TOTALITY by Richard Raymond | 43:27\nSet during the Great American Eclipse, this is a story about the sacrifices we make for love and the intensity of a looming moment that can change everything.

            "description": "A grieving plumber seeks out a disgraced quantum physicist to rid himself of a tormenting \"Hum\".\n\n\"HUM\" by Stefano Nurra\n\nSubscribe to the DUST Newsletter: https://bit.ly/signal_newsletter\n\n#DUST #scifi #shortfilm\n\nMore About HUM: \nGrieving plumber Chris Page is tormented by a mysterious low frequency noise seemingly only he can hear. The unexplained phenomenon known as \"The Hum\". With the help of rogue scientist Prof. McAven, Chris traces the origin of the sound, discovering way more than expected. \n\nDirector's Statement:\nAlthough I am a great fan of science fiction movies, some of the best sci-fi experiences I can remember come from reading books. Especially the relatively new breed of sci-fi known as The New Weird. Hum is my personal contribution to the genre, an emotional short story, very much in the style of writers of the New Weird movement I love (such as China Mieville, Jeff Vandermeer), exploring quantum physics related concepts that always fascinated me and experimenting with the science fiction medium. Science-fiction has a tendency of proposing very \"visual-based\" concepts (aliens, otherwordly beings, machines, etc...) and I wanted to go down a more sound-based premise, something that really lends itself to more abstract thought and opens doors to relate science with mystical theories. Hum is inspired by real theories surrounding the nature of the still unexplained phenomenon known as \"The Hum\". Only 2% of populaiton around the world can perceive it and the descriptions fo how it sounds are scarce and difficult to recreate. Therefore, developing the sound for the film was a massive challenge that took a long time, mostly based on the recording of the movements of the Earth's core mixed with the chants of Tuvan monks. Without giving too much away theme-wise, this is also related to the film's theme, rooted it in a strong emotional premise such as reconnecting with the here and now. This, together with the film's premise, demanded extreme care in developing a look that wasn't too cold and detached, whilst at the same time exploring the fantasy world of the Hum in a visually impressive way. The inspiration for Hum's look and its visual effects comes from research of alchemical drawings, illustrations from The Tibetan Book of the Dead as well as an healthy dose of graphic novels staples such as The Sandman and the early issues of Hellblazer. \n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

As the sirens sound off. He locks himself inside and braces for nuclear war. After the dust has settled and the radiation clears, Jeffrey must live out the next 3 months with only himself for company. After this time Jeffrey is ready to unlock the hatch to the outside world and witness what has become of planet Earth.\n\nDirector's Statement:\nI wanted to create a simple contained short story based on a much larger feature film\nscreenplay I had written, this set up seemed the obvious choice. There is a deeper hidden\nmeaning to the story that some may see but others may not.\n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

            "description": "A suburban stay-at-home dad builds an autonomous robot out of his mower, but when he finds out his creation is taking over his life he sets out to destroy it. \n\n\"Pink Plastic Flamingos\" by Colin West\n\nSubscribe to the DUST Newsletter: https://bit.ly/signal_newsletter\n\n#DUST #scifi #shortfilm\n\nMore About Pink Plastic Flamingos: \nLife sucks for George. So he builds a robot to make it better. It gets better. Then... it gets worse.\n\nFilmmaker's Statement:\nThere has been a lot of hype in the news lately about the rise of sentient AI. These stories conjure thoughts of dystopian wasteland futures seen in things like Terminator or I, Robot. But what we’re really aiming to do with AI, long term, is to make life “better” (whatever that means) for us humans. So, is it getting better? With Pink Plastic Flamingos I was trying to draw that narrative out, deliberately straying from the typical Asimov-ian robot dystopia and placing this story in a future that was much like our own, but not exactly– setting the film in a tone rather than a time. I wanted to give way for a kind of comedic fable about the potential human reaction to their own act of creation. I often find it quite ironic that humans are so headstrong about creating this new form of artificial intelligence yet are at the same time so utterly terrified of it. On a side note, I feel that if sentient robots were to write their own Grimm fairy tales, this might be one of them. \n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

            "description": "In the near future, a young father’s morning routine is put on the fritz when he uncovers his wife’s bizarre secret, one that forces him to question his sense of self and his role in the family.\n\n\"Faulty Father\" by Benjamin Welmond\n\nSubscribe to the DUST Newsletter: https://bit.ly/signal_newsletter\n\n#DUST #scifi #shortfilm\n\nMore About Faulty Father: \nOne morning, a young father wakes up to find another version of himself in his closet. As it turns out- his wife has a back up version. Inspired by the works of David Cronenberg and Terry Gilliam, Faulty Father is a dark sci-fi film with horror inspirations and a comedic twist. It deals with themes around artificial intelligence, and fatherhood.\n\nFilmmaker's Statement:\n\"No matter how hard people try, they screw up their children. We tell ourselves that we will do a better job than our parents, but changes in society and technology, along with our own baggage, undermine such aspirations. The best science fiction is not about how our relationship to technology is evolving, but how it changes the way we treat each other. In making Faulty Father I ask the question: what if you could take the human error out of parenthood? Could you make a computer application that faultlessly raises a child? Visually, the film is a homage to my favorite science fiction films of the 80s, such as Videodrome and Brazil.\"\n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

It won’t cost him a penny but there is one catch: he won’t remember any of it when he gets back. Why would anyone do that?

            "description": "A guy convinces his wife to try out a new AI technology to spice up their sex life, but gets a bit more spice than he bargained for.\n\n\"Face Swap\" directed by Einat Tubi and David Gidali\n\nSubscribe to the DUST Newsletter: https://bit.ly/signal_newsletter\n\n#DUST #scifi #shortfilm\n\nMore About Face Swap: \nThis short film may not feature internationally recognized A-list movie stars. But with the help of machine learning AI algorithms, our actors may seem a bit familiar. A cautionary science fiction satire, FACE SWAP is arguably the first narrative film using the “deepfakes” process as a storytelling tool.\n\nDirector's Statement:\nFACE SWAP takes a satirical look at the imminent new reality ushered in by the advent of face swapping apps known as \"Deepfakes\". It poses the question: In today's world, do our faces still belong to us? Inspired by the broader ramifications of newly accessible machine learning algorithms and face recognition AI, we set out to create a parody portraying one way things could evolve. In an age in which the reliance on our eyes and ears for the truth has become exponentially more fragile, we hope our film serves as a social commentary on the looming implications of such technologies - the good, the bad and the ugly (or beautiful, in the case of our face swappers).\n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

Starring Jacob Anderson who played Grey Worm from \"Game of Thrones.\"\n\n\"The Super Recogniser\" by Jennifer Sheridan\n\nSubscribe to the DUST Newsletter: https://bit.ly/signal_newsletter\n\n#DUST #scifi #shortfilm\n\nMore About The Super Recogniser: \nThanks to his exceptional facial recognition skills, Scott (Jacob Anderson) has been recruited to work in a secret government initiative. Under the watchful eye of his tough-talking supervisor Agent Williams (Ritu Arya), this Super Recogniser is over-worked and under pressure as he spends hours seeking terrorists and criminals captured on CCTV cameras.\n\nDirector's Statement:\nI made this short after ﬁnding out a friend of mine had interviewed to become a 'Super Recogniser' for the Metropolitan Police. He didn't get the job unfortunately, but I started learning about what a Super Recogniser is and does and ideas began to form. Before I knew it I had a script and was raising the money to make it into this short. I'm really happy with how well it did on the festival circuit and now I'm developing it into a TV series. Really excited about where this idea could go.\n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

            "description": "Under the eye of an A.I. camera system, an online 'livecaster' with a volatile brand has a crisis of conscience in a future where jobs are limited and conflict is currency.\n\n\"LIVE\" written & directed by Taryn O'Neill\n\nSubscribe to the DUST Newsletter: https://bit.ly/signal_newsletter\n\n#DUST #scifi #shortfilm\n\nMore About LIVE: \n“The one finite resource we have besides the resources of this planet and time is our ATTENTION”. Kevin Kelley, co-founder of WIRED. \n\nA woman wakes to the memory of a fist connecting with her face. She is bruised and bloodied, barely able to get out of bed. She gives no indication to what has happened to her. Through an audio command she renders a holographic screen showing stats and numbers that render her despondent. Finally having numbed the pain with ice and vodka, she activates her A.I. camera system and goes 'LIVE' -- talking straight into camera, portraying a brash, sexy character who engages in 'fight clubs' to engage her viewers. The previous night's fight is how she is so bruised. But this volatile persona is taking a toll on her... not just physically but emotionally, and the arrival of her much younger boyfriend, an e-gamer, brings this crisis to a heated climax, especially when he suggests some not so savory alternatives to her 'character'. But in a future where A.I. and automation have decimated the job market and where personal conflict is currency, what options does she have?\n\nA message from the filmmaker:\nThe world of tomorrow is my present. Being a voracious researcher of science and technology, my brain jumps to how each new innovation will affect our future, both for good, and for ill. LIVE examines two issues that are affecting almost every demographic of society: the coming disruption of Artificial Intelligence and the proliferation (and effects) of social media. The data shows that social media algorithms are optimized for profit and efficiency. But it has also been demonstrated that ‘for profit’ and ‘for human health and wellness’ are not correlated. LIVE was made to be a cautionary, a no holds barred story that examines the dark truths behind our online personas and the lengths we will go for engagement. Engagement is currency, conflict is currency. LIVE examines the personal cost of it. It turns a lens on the public's fear of what the near future will look like, where the future of jobs, our very means to live, is unclear at best. Let the debate to change the system ensue. \n\nCast:\nMegan (Woman) - Taryn O’Neill\nLiam (Guy) - Tyler Wiseman\nOpponent - America Young\nReferee - Mig Micaro\n \nCrew:\nDirector - Taryn O’Neill\nWriter - Taryn O’Neill\nProducer - Diana Davis Dyer\nProducer - Taryn O’Neill\nExecutive Producer - We Make Movies\nDirector of Photography - Arlene Muller\nProduction Designer - Katie Moest \nArt Director - Kim Brunner\nEditor - Jeffrey Reeser\nVFX Editor - Bruce Monach\nVFX Consultant - Rob O’Neill\nMusic - John T Higgins\nSound Editor - John T Higgins\nFull Cast & Crew list can be found here: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9425142\n\nConnect with Taryn O'Neill:\nWebsite: https://www.tarynoneill.com \nFollow Taryn O'Neill on Twitter: https://twitter.com/tarynoneill\n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

            "description": "Four men explore an abandoned research facility. Within the station unsettling signs of disorder are revealed, and in the lowest level of the facility, a chilling discovery is made.\n\n\"Echoes In The Ice\" written and directed by BJ Verot\n\nSubscribe to the DUST Newsletter: https://bit.ly/signal_newsletter\n\n#DUST #scifi #shortfilm\n\nA message from the filmmaker:\nI wanted to create a project that played with Lovecraftian themes, and ECHOES IN THE ICE is that film. The story deals with four men as they search through an abandoned Arctic research facility that isn’t on any map, and they are in no way prepared for what they encounter. \n\nSome people have said that, tonally, ECHOES shares some commonalities with JOHN CARPENTER’S THE THING vibe, which I take as a great compliment. However, whereas THE THING and Lovecraft’s AT THE MOUNTAINS OF MADNESS take place in the Antarctic, this story takes place in the Arctic, just north of the continental U.S. and Canada. It’s in our own backyard, and if you were to stumble upon this facility, you too would find yourself in danger. \n\nI typically like to shoot my films in 2.35 aspect ratio. There's something about science fiction films specifically, that really resonate with that visual aesthetic. Personally, I think it has something to do with the wider framing in a narrower field of view. Everything on screen is important, and you can use the negative space to your advantage.\n\nMany people have asked if there is a grander story to ECHOES IN THE ICE, and the answer is YES! This could easily be seen as a dark, and terrible prologue that sets off a chain reaction of events as the situation continues to escalate. \n\nI hope you enjoy the film, \nBJ Verot \n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

            "description": "After the death of her companion, a scientist is trapped by herself on an outpost near Jupiter begins to imagine, or realize, that she is not alone after all.\n\n\"Control\" written and directed by Carroll Brown \n\nSubscribe to the DUST Newsletter: https://bit.ly/signal_newsletter\n\n#DUST #scifi #shortfilm\n\nMore About Control:\nMission Specialist Elizabeth Henstridge thought she knew the risks when she was selected as part of a two-person crew on an exploratory mission to Jupiter's moon Callisto. What she didn't expect, what nobody expected, was that her companion would die, leaving her alone 600 million miles from home for almost three months until the relief crew would arrive. Grief, isolation...is that all it is when she is suddenly awoken by a knock on the station door? And Mission \"Control\" back home isn't helping, not when they are complaining about how she handled the body of her companion, and deﬁnitely not when they start responding in real time despite the two-hour signal delay between Jupiter and Earth. When \"Control\" reveals that it may not be who she thinks it is, Elizabeth begins to question her sanity, and her safety.\n\nA message from the filmmaker:\nThe core idea for Control came from a story I had read about a woman scientist at an Antarctica station that had to perform a biopsy on herself after falling ill in the middle of the Antarctic winter when no help could be ﬂown in. I tried to imagine the fear, the sense of isolation, the panic. I wanted to ramp all of that up to an exponential degree, and decided to set the events on an outpost so remote that even just talking to home was a delayed experience; these are the harsh realities of space and physics. Playing with the idea, I had the idle thought \"what if suddenly they responded in real time?\" and I was off to the races.\n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

            "description": "Two middle-schoolers try an experiment at home involving ping pong balls, red light, and white noise.\n\nA kid takes his science experiment too far in this exclusive premiere.\n\n\"Lucid Nation\" written and directed by Stephen Turselli\n\nSubscribe to the DUST Newsletter: https://bit.ly/signal_newsletter\n\n#DUST #scifi #shortfilm\n\nMore About Lucid Nation: \nBest friends Henry and Josh attempt an experiment at home that they learned about in school. After stealing a red light bulb from the school's dark room, they cover their eyes with ping pong balls and listen to white noise in an effort to get their mind to hallucinate. After a few failed trials, Josh concedes that it's just a silly experiment. However, Henry is convinced that, with a few adjustments, it could still work. Each night after school for the next few days, Henry tinkers and perfects the parameters of his experiment. He blacks out his window, he glues the ping pong balls onto swim goggles. He adds more and more light bulbs to the array on his desk. Eventually, he builds a turbo-headset, designed to amplify all sights and sounds coming to it. When he tries the experiment for a ﬁnal time, Henry goes too far before he realizes he's not coming back.\n\nA message from the filmmaker:\nLucid Nation was a project that came to fruition in a similar fashion to the plot of our story. We found ourselves fascinated by the experiment, so visually interesting and bizarre, to cut ping pong balls in half and use scotch tape to crudely tape them to your own face just to stare at colored light and listen to television static. Such a wacky combination, and it made for an interesting ﬁlm topic. When we couldn't crack the story, my producing partner mailed me red light bulbs and ping pong balls and insisted I tried it. Through these failed trials is how we came to the story told in Lucid Nation. Kids are imaginative enough to want to experience this but naive enough to actually try. Then, like any other addictive substance, it's a short and fast trip down the rabbit hole.\n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

            "description": "An interstellar mission crash lands on an abandoned earth now devoid of life and water. In a race against time and resources they must not only survive the elements but face what once was.\n\nSurvival is only the beginning.\n\n\"What Once Was\" by Sean G. Penberthy\n\nSubscribe to the DUST Newsletter: https://bit.ly/signal_newsletter\n\n#DUST #scifi #shortfilm\n\nMore About What Once Was: \nA century after Earth was abandoned, a returning salvage mission crashes on the planet and maroons the surviving astronauts in a wasteland, devoid of life and water. In a race against time and resources, the remaining crew must search for a deserted launch facility and soon discover that their greatest threat isn’t the environment, but each other.\n\nA message from the filmmaker:\nThe idea came from the challenge of telling the story about a broken family and how each of them is dealing with the pieces that are left. On top of that I wanted the story to be based in the science ﬁction world, but also not rely on visual effects and keep as much of it as possible, practical. The idea is to throw the audience into a world that was familiar but also something empty, stark and alien at the same time; something that would reﬂect the family’s current emotional state. I wanted to build a world that was much larger and felt deeper than the time we were conﬁned to. There’s deﬁnitely a story before where we pick up and there is certainly one after we leave our characters, but I wanted to focus on the crux, the turning point where it all goes awry. That’s where the interest lies, that’s where the emotions boil over. The ﬁlm gives a glimpse into this world and touches on the depth of their emotions, sending us on a journey that proves that the past often dictates the future, and knowing who to trust isn’t always as clear as it seems.\n\nMore about the filmmaker:\nWriter, Director and Producer Sean Gregory Penberthy grew up in suburban Michigan where he attended various Art Schools and learned to hone his skills in Painting and Sculpting.\n\nAt 22 he joined the Military and served as a MARSOC Marine through wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Upon his return, he concluded his education and graduated from California State University, Northridge School of Film & Television Arts with a degree in Cinematography. He found his ﬁrst production jobs working for visual effects houses Method Studios and Company 3 employed as a digital artist on such ﬁlms as “Pirates of the Caribbean, On Stranger Tides,” “The Tree of Life” and “Let Me In”.\n\nHaving learned the foundations and importance of detail in high-budget ﬁlmmaking, Sean began creating his own content by writing and shooting commercials and music videos for local businesses and musicians. With limited funding, he was forced to reﬁne his skills in all aspects of ﬁlmmaking serving as his own Writer, Cinematographer, Editor and Visual Effects Artist. His ﬁrst directorial hit was a music video “The Edge of Glory,” a story about equal rights that received international acclaim and more than 20 million views.\n\nBranching out, Sean moved on to work as a Producer and Editor in network television helping to create shows for National Geographic, TLC and Discovery. Recently he completed the short ﬁlm; “What Once Was” having won Best Director, Best Screenplay and Best Picture on the festival circuit. He is currently in production on the short ﬁlm “Lost Archipelago” and a yet to be titled feature ﬁlm, due out in 2020.\n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

            "description": "In a next-generation prison, inmates are “corrected” over a few days by an A.I. linked to their consciousness. Cyrus, a lonely parole officer, becomes obsessed with Alice – a sociopathic inmate that the A.I. seems unable to reform.\n\n\"Corrections\" by Nick Tucker\n\nSubscribe to the DUST Newsletter: https://bit.ly/signal_newsletter\n\n#DUST #scifi #shortfilm\n\nMore About Corrections: \nIn a future prison, inmates are not locked up for years – they’re connected to an accelerated simulation that allows them to serve their entire sentence in a few days. What these inmates don't know is that before they're released, they undergo a \"Parole Simulation\" that seems utterly real – and their moral resolve is tested in their most private moments. In this way, only the truly reformed are deemed \"corrected\" and released back into society. Cyrus, a lonely parole technician, becomes obsessed with Alice – an alluring and sociopathic inmate that the system seems unable to reform. While most inmates are corrected and released quickly, Alice has failed nearly a thousand Parole Simulations. Cyrus tries convincing Alice to undergo a procedure that will radically alter her personality, so she can finally be corrected and released. But Alice has her own plans. Despite having her memory wiped between Parole Simulations, she gets to Cyrus – seducing him and chipping away at his sanity … until it's not clear who has the upper hand.\n\nA message from the filmmaker:\nCorrections is a story about a world of nearly complete state surveillance, a world that has abandoned trust for security — a world distressingly similar to our own. I wrote Corrections as a way to examine issues of surveillance, privacy, and the role they play\nin how we make choices. How can we be our true self when we're constantly under the eyes of others? We like to think that surveillance can only reveal people's true character, but the\npressure of constant observation has just as much power to influence how we behave and think of ourselves. Corrections is also about relationships between people, the way we exert power over others in surprising ways, and how we make ourselves into victims, or victimizers, without realizing it. Cyrus and Alice are locked in a power struggle, their drives and weaknesses conspiring to create a truly toxic relationship. I want the film to leave viewers wondering if it's possible to truly correct people, and if we really want to live in a world where there's no room for the people we can't \"fix.\"\n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

The protagonist’s childhood is a metaphor for human civilization itself - with her curiosity and gumption. She grows dreaming about having the stars in her hands to actually going on a voyage beyond our planet in her adulthood. Her story involves her recognizing the childhood dream that we are all meant to be carrying.\n\nDivya More is a Bombay based writer/director. Mayukh Goswami is an Indian citizen working as a Designer-animator in New York, Subigya Basnet is a citizen of Nepal working in America as a video producer and Ujjwal is studying audio production in Delhi.\n\nThis cross country collaboration was an attempt by the creators to tell humane stories, without and beyond boundaries. The ﬁlm was made over skype calls and shared over google drive.\n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

            "description": "During a sleepover, four 9-year-old girls obsessed with space embark on a secret mission in their cardboard rocket. When Dad returns home, what will become of their mission?\n\nWe're celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Moon landing with the exclusive premiere of \"Space Girls\" on DUST.\n\n\"Space Girls\" by Carys Watford\n\nSubscribe to the DUST Newsletter: https://bit.ly/signal_newsletter\n\n#DUST #scifi #shortfilm\n\nMore About Space Girls: \n'Space Girls' is a celebration of the power of imagination, the importance of STEM education and girl power! \n\nI wanted to make a fun adventure film about the wonders of space & the importance of space travel. The innocent wonder of childhood – where playtime feels real, alive & magical – felt like an ideal setting in which to explore these ideas.\n\nI was conscious about wanting the protagonists of the film to be a band of girls. The girls are smart, confident & determined – they are obsessed with science & space & want to study hard to achieve their dreams. Geena Davis’ research has compellingly shown that female characters in kids’ media are often underdeveloped, sidelined or solely there as a plot device. It is important that we promote female agency & science positive goals for the next generation.\n\nInspired by the adage – “If she can see it, she can be it” – I want ‘Space Girls’ to promote & inspire young girls to dream big & work hard so that they can achieve anything they set their minds to. Even becoming an astronaut & travelling to outer space!\n\nFilmmaker's Links:\nAdditional Footage courtesy of Earth Science and Remote Sensing Unit, NASA Johnson Space Center: https://eol.jsc.nasa.gov\n\nAdditional Footage courtesy of NASA & Hubble Space Telescope: https://images.nasa.gov; http://hubblesite.org\n\nEnd credits by Daniel Lam: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCE-IzBAZzsoLYKrIuZlTT2Q\n\nJapanese subtitles provided by Yoshinori OKubo\nPortuguese (Brazilian) subtitles provided by Erick Soares Figueiredo\n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

            "description": "Lifelong friends and scientists Nate, Chloe and Bernard believe they are safely creating A.I. within virtual reality, until their creation, Kate, learns it's at risk of being shut down.\n\nAn A.I. program learns it's at risk of being shut down, how will it respond?\n \n\"Watch Room\" Directed by Noah Wagner\n\nSubscribe to the DUST Newsletter: https://bit.ly/signal_newsletter\n\n#DUST #scifi #shortfilm\n\nMore About Watch Room: \nCountless nights of creative problem solving have brought longtime friends and scientists NATE, BERNARD, and CHLOE as far as they've come. Collaborating from Nate's ramshackle garage, the trio has blazed a trail to the frontier of Artificial Intelligence - to KATE, a self-aware AI designed to behave like a human, contained to and tested within the safety of a computer program that interfaces with the real world via bootstrapped virtual reality technology. \n\nWhen Kate fails a key experiment, Bernard and Chloe insist they shut her down and go back to the drawing board, but Kate has other plans.\n\nWritten by Michael Koehler\nProduced by Julia Elaine Mills, Mike Kaney II, Scott Amenta\n\nDirector's Statement:\nWhile Watch Room might be considered both science and fiction, its core concerns are far more rooted in the former. Luminaries across scientific disciplines have warned of the perils inherent in developing AI. The trouble is, I think humans tend to be more reactive than proactive when it comes to abstract issues, and moreover, have more immediate concerns - like paying rent and putting food on the table. And to make matters worse, I know I’m no exception myself -- this flaw is a part of my own hard-wiring.\n\nTherein lies the crux of why I was driven to make this film. Despite an evolving canon of grounded AI material, the way AI has typically been portrayed on-screen has become synonymous with artificially-conscious androids rebelling against their human masters. That makes for great entertainment, but it clouds the issue and hyperbolizes the reality of it. There is certainly risk, but I remain cautiously optimistic as long as we’re responsible “parents”. Just as in any parent-child dynamic, the child inevitably surpasses the parent’s capabilities. How that child behaves once it gains independence, however, is greatly influenced by how it was raised and what it was taught. To me, the precious dynamic of that relationship – between Nate and Kate – is at the heart of this film.\n\nIn speaking with AI scientists, we sought to create a more nuanced portrayal of the spirit behind the conversations happening in research labs around the world today. With this in mind, we hope audiences come away from this film with a renewed sense of curiosity for the subject and a cautiously optimistic attitude toward our future.\n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

Other honorees included Star Wars The Force Awakens, The Martian, and Pixar’s Inside Out. \n\nHard Reset is the first 3D stereoscopic graduate thesis film created in partnership with UT3D, the country's first stereoscopic certificate production program at a public university.\n\nDIRECTOR'S STATEMENT:\nHard Reset was my thesis film at the University of Texas at Austin's MFA film program. It is a love letter to my favorite genre across all media, science-fiction. The film was shot natively in stereoscopic 3D with the support of UT3D and It was filmed mostly in studio at UT with some additional location photography around town. The piece is actually a pilot for a much larger project I would like to develop (with or without 3D) using the world we have created. I directed, co-wrote and did all of the visual effects on the film. I am proud of the film as in the past most of my work has solely focused on visuals and lacked clear narrative, and I feel that this is a development and step into the way I would want my future projects to progress. From start to finish it was a passion project that took almost 2 years. It owes everything to the films that inspired me to become a filmmaker and the genre that defines all the stories I want to tell. \n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

            "description": "On election night, a janitor feels cheated out of a life he might have lived when his own clone becomes the President. He goes on a bender to seek justice, encountering new forms of prejudice, dismissal, and classism. In a society where the morality around cloning is dividing the masses, physically looking like the newly elected President has its own dangers…\n\n\"The Replacement\" Written and Directed by Sean Miller, Produced by Naz Khan\n\nSubscribe to the DUST Newsletter: https://bit.ly/signal_newsletter\n\n#DUST #scifi #shortfilm\n\nDirector's Statement:\nThe Replacement was born out of an interest in technology out pacing society and cultural\npanic. We seem to be speeding toward faster solutions for our problems with little regard to the side effects they are having on culture as a whole. \n\nThe Replacement is a film about how the best of intentions can get us into places we didn't expect. The Replacement reflects this with a world of clones that can out-perform their originals at everything. Having just won equal rights, the clones are stars of a new identity politics movement, with less and less room for natural born humans.\n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

            "description": "One night, a teenage girl disappears without a trace. Years later, her friend returns home and finds himself being beckoned back into those woods - the last place she was seen alive. An atmospheric sci-fi about the archetypal lost girl. \n\nExclusive premiere of \"After Her\" starring Stranger Things's Natalia Dyer.\n\n\"After Her\" by Aly Migliori\n\nSubscribe to the DUST Newsletter: https://bit.ly/signal_newsletter\n\n#DUST #scifi #shortfilm\n\nDirector’s Statement: \nI was interested in making a short that confronts the perversion of the “missing girl story” in both film and in reality. I wanted to create something meditative and personal with a small group of collaborators; I shot most of the film myself, including the VFX, which were hand done in my parents’ basement. I’m from Rhode Island and grew up reading Lovecraft, and was incredibly inspired by his worlds, his characters, and their maddening search for the bigger picture, the great answers. As Callum searches for Haley, the alluring missing girl of his past, his expectations get challenged. His journey spans fertile woods, deep caves, and fallopian tunnels. He grows to realize that he is a passenger, not a pioneer, while she is the leader, not the victim. \n\nStarring Natalia Dyer and Christopher Dylan White\nDirected by Aly Migliori\nShot by Aly Migliori, David Raboy\nProduced by Zander Fife, Laura Heberton\nA First Hunt Film\n\nOfficial Selection: \nFlorida Film Festival, Woodstock Film Festival, Atlanta Film Festival, Sarasota Film Festival, IFFBoston, Montclair Film Festival, Dallas Film Festival, RSC Shorts by Denver Film Society, Nashville Film Festival, Las Vegas International Film Festival, Sidewalk Film Festival, Rhode Island International Film Festival, Hollyshorts Film Festival, Bend Film Festival, Eastern Oregon Film Festival, New Hampshire Film Festival, Dancing Spider Film Festival, Drunken Film Festival Oakland, Citizen Jane Film Festival, Portland Film Festival, Nitehawk Film Festival - Audience Award Winner\n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

His name is Hugo. His frail body and wispy hair belie the concentration in his eyes… He’s making something… Some great project…\n\nIt is a cold and gloomy future – or perhaps that is just his perception. \n\nMail arrives via automated drone; its animated smiles and digitised platitudes can’t burn away the carbon grey clouds or disguise the filthy towering skyscrapers. \n\nThe drone is Hugo’s only visitor. It brings a letter for his dead wife.\n\nHe returns to his work, as he always does. \n\nToday is special though. Today, Hugo will test his creation. \n\nToday, the not-too-distant future will become the not-too-distant past.\n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

As Caner directs the questions, Sercan is faced with the things he has done; his life.\n\nRather than telling Sercan the answer to why he in this room, he skillfully wants Sercan to ﬁnd it out himself. He tells Sercan that what he did yesterday is related with him being in the room and thereafter.\n\nSercan talks about not having found the happiness he dreams of with his girlfriend Derya, the love and trust towards his father, the new job interview he has to attend during the day, and the interest he has towards Selin, a friend of Derya.\n\nAs the conversation continues, Sercan suddenly sees that it is himself that is talking to him and understands that it has been himself who was asking the questions from the beginning. However, his alter ego facing him explains the truth as his confusion continues. He tells that Sercan is in fact a new generation hologram, created by an application named UmeetU and that he has up to date access to all information and interaction of the user on all social platforms.\n\nThe objective of the UmeetU application is to collect all information that will enable the user to be better, more productive and happier during this mutual session and to ensure that he can experience the day optimally, energetically and with higher concentration by knowing the potential situations and attitudes he must refrain from.\n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

On their way, they encounter a large, abandoned spaceship that is drifting in the orbit of a mysterious planet. They board the ship with anticipation of the great discoveries to uncover inside. However, they do not know what terrible secret this spacecraft keeps -- a nightmarish threat which is far bigger and scarier than anything they could have imagined.\n\n\"Azarkant\" by Andrey Klimov\n\nSubscribe to the DUST Newsletter: https://bit.ly/signal_newsletter\n\n#DUST #scifi #shortfilm \n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

Despite the inhabitants doing things which are mostly normal and harmless, he gets his observations terribly wrong, ultimately ending everyone in a heap of trouble. Mixed into his observations are psychedelic daydreams; pataphorical ﬁzzles, which take each and every apartments’ setting into a whole new universe. Told in a quirky and tongue-in-cheek way, the futuristic drama comments on data protection and privacy in modern society.\n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

In a futuristic rural village filled with archaic machines, he must become a ruthless vigilante to find his missing sister.\n\n\"Tonight I Strike\" by Dan Gaud\n\nSubscribe to the DUST Newsletter: https://bit.ly/signal_newsletter\n\n#DUST #scifi #shortfilm\n\nMore About Tonight I Strike: \nLiam's British robot housekeeper thinks he's a loser. A true slacker. But his younger sister Ana doesn't care. She loves her brother no matter how flawed. Liam does his best to take care of her while their father is away working in the mines up on Mars. Things go sour when Ana suddenly goes missing. Putting posters on telephone poles and waiting for the authorities to do something is not enough for Liam. For the first in his life, he decides to take control. Night by night, he slowly becomes a masked vigilante hell bent on finding her. With a single crowbar strapped to his back using magnets, he forces his way into the criminal underworld in order to extract information from anyone that crosses his path. A tale of violence, redemption and robots.\n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

He cleans up after you and me. He picks up the mess we discard but yet remains invisible to all around him. Tergo’s a lost soul in the London urban machine. He’s ready to leave the life he leads. \n\nTergo is the fifth short film from London based film collective Pallas Pictures and their first to have an entirely CG lead character. A labour of love and devotion by director and Pallas Pictures founder Charles Willcocks, it is the existential tale of a cleaning robot lost amongst the everyday drain of work in London. In a city of millions of strangers all living digital relationships it’s a modern day fable for anybody who might be lonely and caught up in the rat race of life.\n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

The only thing that distinguishes us from them is that we can still control them - but for how long if they have assumed the characteristics that seemed to identify us as human beings? How long? if we exceed by them in physical force. The promise is a short film that looks at the future reality of a world in which those things created by man are a step to be confused with us.\n\n\"The Promise\" by Erwin Jaquez\n\nSubscribe to the DUST Newsletter: https://bit.ly/signal_newsletter\n\n#DUST #scifi #shortfilm\n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

Next, we see her running through the woods in an effort to stay hidden from the multiplying alien force. \n\nAs night falls over the forest she is hiding in we learn more about what has brought her to this place. She explains that her father learnt too much about the visitors and now he has gone. \n\nWe watch as she builds a ﬁre and prepares herself for an ancient ceremony of communication. She explains that thanks to our obsession with the material we were defenceless against the alien visitors. By neglecting our spiritual development we failed to take our place amongst the real Galactic Community. \n\nAs the ﬁlm concludes we see her begin the ceremony.

            "description": "A new law mandating the public’s use of nanotechnology meets resistance from hacktivists who are conspiring to thwart the impending roll-out of a dangerous hardware upgrade.\n\n\"Nano\" by Mike Manning\n\nSubscribe to the DUST Newsletter: https://bit.ly/signal_newsletter\n\n#DUST #scifi #shortfilm\n\nMore About Nano: \nIn the near future, advances in biotechnology have bridged the gap between man and machine. Developed by ASPIRE, a seemingly benevolent corporation inspired by the likes of Apple and Google, “Nanos” are microscopic, probe-like machines that have the ability to interact with human DNA and alter expressions of the genome within seconds of entering the bloodstream. For the purpose of health or “bio-maintenance,” they have the ability to alter the body’s autonomic systems and metabolic rates, regulate fat and/or muscle production, and even slow the aging process. They also allow for fun, non-essential “bio-mods,” such as the ability to change one’s hair color, raise one’s adrenaline, or even enhance one’s pleasure during sex.\n\nZOLEE, a member of an underground network of hackers who are conspiring to thwart the impending roll-out of the government mandated “Nano 2.0,” intends to steal classiﬁed data pertaining to Aspire’s new government contract. But in order to do so, she must access the Aspire Nano Network using the login credentials of MAX ROTH, a corrupt agent with the Biotechnology Crime Division (BCD). His connection to the Aspire Network is biometrically encrypted, accessible only via a key that’s docked to his arm--a hardlined connection to his own Nanos. Posing as a prostitute, Zolee hopes to seduce Roth (a known deviant with pension for Nano app-enhanced sex), distracting and ultimately subduing him so that she may hack into his account and steal the sensitive data. This proves to be easier said than done during an intense game of cat and mouse, leading to an exciting showdown that pits Zolee against the sadistic BCD Agent.\n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

They've secured a contract to harvest a large deposit of the elusive gems hidden in the depths of the moon's toxic forest.

With no way to control when or where they end up, it's anyone's guess as to whether they'll be dancing to the real Elvis or running from a T-rex. \nFor one brave and earnest 12-year-old boy, Charlie, the risk is worth the reward. He wants nothing more than to go back to a time when his mother is alive again. His ﬁercely loyal best friends, Puck and Vincent, are always up for the adventure. But after what happened the last time they traveled, they swore a sacred oath to end time travel for good. When a particularly haunting storm rolls through town, Charlie's desire tp travel gets the best of him. But his friends know him all too well. They bust him at Charlie's tree house, their preferred place to travel from, before he can take off.\n\nUnfortunately, for the \"Three Musketeers,' Pucks blabbermouth has brought some uninvited guests along for the ride. With the secret ﬁnally out, the group is forced to travel with the impulsive and audacious 13-year-old Maggie and her 18 year old meathead brother Bruiser. \n\nWhen Charlie's father, Jason is awoken by their dog Sunny, he realizes Charlie's gone missing. As he and Sunny race to trace Charlie's steps through the rain, he notices the tree house as it explodes with the mysterious electromagnetic energy of the activated time machine. But before he can reach the kids, he notices an ominous hooded ﬁgure watching the tree house from the dark forest nearby. \n\nTree House Time Machine is a proof of concept short intended for an episodic television format. Set in the 90's, it captures the in-demand nostalgia of that era and is akin to Goonies meets Back to the Future. A dramedy with as much heart as laughs, Tree House Time Machine is sure to entertain kids of all ages.\n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

            "description": "In a dystopian future, the last human is raised by a machine. He struggles with the loneliness of no human interaction and questions the teachings of a mysterious religious 'Manual' which the machine claims is holy.\n\n\"The Manual\" by Wil Magness\n\nSubscribe to the DUST Newsletter: https://bit.ly/signal_newsletter\n\n#DUST #scifi #shortfilm\n\nMore About The Manual:\nIn the distant future, James is the last human on Earth. He is raised and protected by a humanoid robot, the Machine, who brings him up on a strange composite religion described in a handheld device called The Manual. The Manual's teachings fuse aspects of old-world religion and incorporate robots as spiritual beings in the afterlife, alongside and equal to humans. The man wrestles with loneliness and depression while the search for other humans becomes more and more futile. As his faith in The Manual is shaken, he sets out to test one of The Manual's core beliefs: reincarnation to the next life in the city of the Creator. What he ﬁnds could be described terribly as exactly that.\n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

            "description": "A skeptical high school student is thrown into a night of adventure after he sees a UFO.\n\n\"Stevie's Aliens\" by Austin S. Harris\n\nSubscribe to the DUST Newsletter: https://bit.ly/signal_newsletter\n\n#DUST #scifi #shortfilm\n\nMore About Stevie's Aliens:\nGreg, a high school student and aspiring writer, ﬁnds out that he has been rejected from his top choice writing school. His conﬁdent and science-oriented girlfriend, Julia, encourages him to get his mind off of the bad news by accompanying her to a concert that night and Greg, now a dejected mess, agrees.\n\nGreg goes home and begins to look through a box of his stories, going back to his childhood, that he keeps under his bed. Just as he’s beginning to enjoy reminiscing he gives himself a paper cut, which prompts him to throw the entire box of stories away.\n\nOn his way to the concert, Greg has an unexplainable encounter with a bright light that seems to be a UFO. He meets Stevie, another high school student who seems to know more about the light, and the two discover that Greg’s paper cut has vanished. Stevie brings Greg back to his house, and perform a deep-thinking ritual that Stevie has pioneered to summon the light. Meanwhile, Julia, who has gone to Greg’s house to look for him, returns home and begins reading a book about UFOs in response to a strange text Greg sends her about his encounter. She leaves a voicemail for Greg saying that she doesn’t believe in UFOs.\n\nGreg and Stevie successfully summon the light, which makes the electronics in Stevie’s room go haywire, but because Julia was reading the book, her electronics are affected too. Seeing the connection between Greg’s text and what happened in her room, she goes to Greg’s house to investigate, where she sees Greg walking with Stevie, guided by a device Stevie is holding. She watches from behind a tree as Greg, now with a renewed sense of optimism, takes his stories out of the trash. She follows the two of them to a large hill, and confronts Greg. Greg convinces her to take a chance on something science can’t prove, and she accepts.\n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

            "description": "In a corporate world void of human interaction, Ennis has lost her ability to relate to others. When her company fires her and forces her into a crowded tenement building, Ennis must overcome her fear of human connection to begin again.\n\n\"The Fringes\" by Lily Darragh Harty\n\nSubscribe to the DUST Newsletter: https://bit.ly/signal_newsletter\n\n#DUST #scifi #shortfilm\n\nMore About The Fringes: \nIn the near future, a company called Allocorp is responsible for telling citizens of Los Angeles where they are allowed to live based on their income level. Ennis Lineau works in the customer service division, where she spends her days being screamed at by dissatisﬁed customers forced to live in terrible housing. Ennis lives a solitary existence at work and at home in her employee housing, until Allocorp dissolves its entire customer service division in favor of automation. Ennis is forced to move out of her apartment and into one of Allocorp’s worst tenements. She fears she’ll be submitted to the horrors she hears about at work, but ﬁnds herself living with two caring roommates: post-doc botany researcher Leda, and mechanic-turned-construction worker Al. \nEnnis continues to serve out her last week of work while bonding with Leda and Al. Leda invites Ennis to her research lab, where Ennis rediscovers her love of plants: practically nonexistent in this desolate future. Soon, however, Leda ﬁnds out that Ennis works at Allocorp and is disgusted that Ennis could work there, a place which has ruined both her livelihood and Al’s, and neglect to admit it. On her last day, Ennis shows up at work only to ﬁnd that the company is kicking her out before even letting her go upstairs. She calls Customer Service to ﬁnd that a recording of her voice is now being used on the other end. Finally, a lifetime of repressed emotions crescendos and Ennis breaks down in her car. She arrives home to ﬁnd Al and Leda gardening on the roof, a haven of nature in the cold city. She apologizes for the error of her ways, and Leda forgives her by giving her a seed to plant in the garden.\n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

On an anonymous assembly line, a creature is built from steel and bone and sent off. Making his way through an old world that is dying and a new world struggling to be born, he begins to sense that he may have a part to play in the evolution of his imperfect kind. This ﬁlm was animated by one person over ten years in four different cities.\n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

They've secured a contract to harvest a large deposit of the elusive gems hidden in the depths of the moon's toxic forest. But there are others roving the wilderness and the job quickly devolves into a fight to survive. Forced to contend not only with the forest's other ruthless inhabitants, but with her own father's greed-addled judgment, the girl finds she must carve her own path to escape.\n\nExclusive Clip from \"Prospect\" by Zeek Earl and Chris Caldwell.\n\nSubscribe to the DUST Newsletter: https://bit.ly/signal_newsletter\n\n#DUST #scifi #shortfilm\n\nAvailable on demand March 8th in US & Canada\nGoogle Play: http://bit.ly/Prospect-Google-Play \niTunes: http://apple.co/2qNYKUA \n\nStarring Pedro Pascal, Sophie Thatcher, Jay Duplass, Andre Royo, Sheila Vand, and Anwan Glover.\n\nWritten and Directed by Zeek Earl and Chris Caldwell.\n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

            "description": "In an alternate 1930's Prohibition-era New York City, it's not liquor that is outlawed but the future production of highly sentient robots known as automatons. Automata follows former NYPD detective turned private eye Sam Regal and his incredibly smart automaton partner, Carl Swangee. Together, they work to solve the case and understand each other in this dystopian America.\n\n\"Automata\" (full series) by Van Alan\n\nSubscribe to the DUST Newsletter: https://bit.ly/signal_newsletter\n\n#DUST #scifi #shortfilm\n\nMore About Automata:\nPutting a science ﬁction twist on the classic hard-boiled detective drama, Automata explores a dystopian alternative version of Prohibition-era New York City, similarly shaped by moral panic even though the alcohol ﬂows freely here. In this universe, Prohibition doesn't ban drinking, but the further production of sapient androids that have become prevalent by the 1920s. As a result, the existing androids, called automatons, are shunned by society, relegated to an untouchable caste of servants despite their near-human thought capability, and are frequently subjected to hatred and violence. It's in this oppressive setting that human private detective Sam Regal (Basil Harris, \"Grimm\") and his automaton partner Carl Swangee (Doug Jones, The Shape of Water) work together to solve cases for both communities, learning to see humanity in one another while trying to prove that justice is still worth serving. \n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

After suffering a stroke a few years ago, Jessica is wheelchair bound and can only communicate through a text-to-speech synthesizer. She lives alone and is descending rapidly into dementia. \n\nThe strained relationship of a stubborn, forgetful mother and her uptight son is put to the test. LIFE BEGINS AT REWIREMENT blurs the lines between memory and oblivion, parent and child, human soul and the spirit of technology.\n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

            "description": "Two evil Henchmen are sent to bury a cofﬁn in the woods. Who or what does it contain? That's out of their pay grade.\n\n\"Hench\" by James Fraser\n\nSubscribe to the DUST Newsletter: https://bit.ly/signal_newsletter\n\n#DUST #scifi #shortfilm\n\nMore About Hench:\nHench follows a pair of charismatic, but extremely ordinary Henchmen. Despite living in a world of Super Heroes and Villains they are caught up in the same domestic problems as the rest of us. These men are never humanized in ﬁlms, always seen but never heard. Hench gives them a voice - whether they have anything worth saying, is up to you to decide.\n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

            "description": "A tense spaceship captain and co-pilot set out to investigate a comet, when a technical fault cuts to the core of their relationship problem…\n\n\"White Lily\" by Tristan Oﬁeld\n\nSubscribe to the DUST Newsletter: https://bit.ly/signal_newsletter\n\n#DUST #scifi #shortfilm\n\nMore About White Lily:\nLeon and Isobel are nearing the critical point of a long space journey. Leon relaxes, watching a hologram of blue skies and recalling a holiday he and Isobel had – but doesn’t remember one of the features she draws attention to, a vase with a white lily. The purpose of their expedition is to investigate a comet. Perhaps because of his fractiousness, Leon sets a ﬂight path that Isobel considers dangerous, and the ship is damaged in the process of its exploration. Buoyed by the success of their trip, Leon and Isobel discuss what they’ll do when they return to Earth. Isobel gets a word wrong, and it becomes apparent there’s something is amiss – she is a holographic companion for Leon, based on the persona of a former lover, and is suffering from the same fault as the ship’s other systems. Isobel insists that Leon reboot her, but he is reluctant to do so since it will wipe her out. \n\nTheir relationship is what’s keeping him together, and for Isobel it’s one that’s based on someone else’s memories. Isobel insists on the reboot, and Leon reminisces about the ‘real’ Isobel, for once addressing the hologram as if it’s her. These are their last moments together. Then the reboot is completed and the holographic companion that was Isobel asks Leon in a blank computerized voice what he wants to call her. Leon prepares for a very long and very lonely trip back to Earth. \n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

            "description": "BAG MAN is the understated story of a 12 year old African American boy, who takes us on an introspective journey out of the city and into the remote countryside of upstate New York. With a mysterious duffle bag in hand, its contents unknown to us, we journey from the urban hustle of Harlem, into the winter-ravaged woodlands a world away. On the road, we slowly discover his real intentions, and the startling significance of what is hidden inside a young boy’s bag.\n\n\"Bag Man\" by Jonathan & Josh Baker\n\nSubscribe to the DUST Newsletter: https://bit.ly/signal_newsletter\n\n#DUST #scifi #shortfilm\n\nPresented by KIN in theaters August 31, 2018\n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

            "description": "In an alternate 1930's Prohibition-era New York City, it's not liquor that is outlawed but the future production of highly sentient robots known as automatons. Automata follows former NYPD detective turned private eye Sam Regal and his incredibly smart automaton partner, Carl Swangee. Together, they work to solve the case and understand each other in this dystopian America.\n\n\"Automata\" by Van Alan - Epilogue\n\nSubscribe to the DUST Newsletter: https://bit.ly/signal_newsletter\n\n#DUST #scifi #shortfilm\n\nMore About Automata:\nPutting a science ﬁction twist on the classic hard-boiled detective drama, Automata explores a dystopian alternative version of Prohibition-era New York City, similarly shaped by moral panic even though the alcohol ﬂows freely here. In this universe, Prohibition doesn't ban drinking, but the further production of sapient androids that have become prevalent by the 1920s. As a result, the existing androids, called automatons, are shunned by society, relegated to an untouchable caste of servants despite their near-human thought capability, and are frequently subjected to hatred and violence. It's in this oppressive setting that human private detective Sam Regal (Basil Harris, \"Grimm\") and his automaton partner Carl Swangee (Doug Jones, The Shape of Water) work together to solve cases for both communities, learning to see humanity in one another while trying to prove that justice is still worth serving. \n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

            "description": "In an alternate 1930's Prohibition-era New York City, it's not liquor that is outlawed but the future production of highly sentient robots known as automatons. Automata follows former NYPD detective turned private eye Sam Regal and his incredibly smart automaton partner, Carl Swangee. Together, they work to solve the case and understand each other in this dystopian America.\n\nSubscribe to the DUST Newsletter: https://bit.ly/signal_newsletter\n\n#DUST #scifi #shortfilm\n\nMore About Automata:\nPutting a science ﬁction twist on the classic hard-boiled detective drama, Automata explores a dystopian alternative version of Prohibition-era New York City, similarly shaped by moral panic even though the alcohol ﬂows freely here. In this universe, Prohibition doesn't ban drinking, but the further production of sapient androids that have become prevalent by the 1920s. As a result, the existing androids, called automatons, are shunned by society, relegated to an untouchable caste of servants despite their near-human thought capability, and are frequently subjected to hatred and violence. It's in this oppressive setting that human private detective Sam Regal (Basil Harris, \"Grimm\") and his automaton partner Carl Swangee (Doug Jones, The Shape of Water) work together to solve cases for both communities, learning to see humanity in one another while trying to prove that justice is still worth serving. \n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

            "description": "BAG MAN is the understated story of a 12 year old African American boy, who takes us on an introspective journey out of the city and into the remote countryside of upstate New York. With a mysterious duffle bag in hand, its contents unknown to us, we journey from the urban hustle of Harlem, into the winter-ravaged woodlands a world away. On the road, we slowly discover his real intentions, and the startling significance of what is hidden inside a young boy’s bag.\n\nSubscribe to the DUST Newsletter: https://bit.ly/signal_newsletter\n\n#DUST #scifi #shortfilm\n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

            "description": "After their father's death, a brother and sister prepare to sell the family farm, but a mysterious force beneath the ground attracts unwelcome visitors. \n\n\"Gamma\" by Dylan Harrington\n\nSubscribe to the DUST Newsletter: https://bit.ly/signal_newsletter\n\n#DUST #scifi #shortfilm\n\nMore About Fight Machine:\nSteven works in the ﬁeld to ﬁx an old drainage system leading into the house before he and his sister sell the farm house. Upon the discovery of a myserteous object buried beneath the ﬁeld, Mysterious Men, disguised as government ofﬁcials, arrive and make Steven and Julie an irrefutable offer to buy the property. Steven refuses to give up on his family farm, much to the dismay of Julie. However, their father left the farm to the older child, Julie. She, with no regards, sells the property to the Mysterious men, but Steven refuses to leave. After spending too much time around the object, Steven becomes sick. The sickness grows more and more intense as he attempts to open a radiating hatch he ﬁnds on top of the object. \n\nSteven nearly escapes death on several occasions as he battles with the mysterious Men, until the ﬁghting leads to the death of one of the men and the other just barley escapes. Steven ﬁnally breaks into the object's hatch and gets inside, but what he ﬁnds is far from the resolution he was hoping for. \n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

            "description": "In an alternate 1930's Prohibition-era New York City, it's not liquor that is outlawed but the future production of highly sentient robots known as automatons. Automata follows former NYPD detective turned private eye Sam Regal and his incredibly smart automaton partner, Carl Swangee. Together, they work to solve the case and understand each other in this dystopian America.\n\n\"Automata\" by Van Alan - Episode 4\n\nSubscribe to the DUST Newsletter: https://bit.ly/signal_newsletter\n\n#DUST #scifi #shortfilm\n\nMore About Automata:\nPutting a science ﬁction twist on the classic hard-boiled detective drama, Automata explores a dystopian alternative version of Prohibition-era New York City, similarly shaped by moral panic even though the alcohol ﬂows freely here. In this universe, Prohibition doesn't ban drinking, but the further production of sapient androids that have become prevalent by the 1920s. As a result, the existing androids, called automatons, are shunned by society, relegated to an untouchable caste of servants despite their near-human thought capability, and are frequently subjected to hatred and violence. It's in this oppressive setting that human private detective Sam Regal (Basil Harris, \"Grimm\") and his automaton partner Carl Swangee (Doug Jones, The Shape of Water) work together to solve cases for both communities, learning to see humanity in one another while trying to prove that justice is still worth serving. \n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

This one is a machine that will allow time traveling. Without any previous notice, Mrs. Fernanda, the controlling mother of Jordi, bumps into his lab to argue with him. When she sees all the mess that is in the room, she horriﬁes and makes his son and the other scientists have a break while she tidies up. When Jordi and his colleagues are in the waiting room, a time jump backwards is produced. Everything points towards the fact that Mrs. Fernanda has activated the quantic transponder accidentally. Jordi’s mother, a complete incompetent with new technologies, will be the only one in the world with the chance to ﬁx the disaster.\n\nFull Credits:\nACTORS:\nJORDI\nPere Costa\nMARÍA FERNANDA\nMercè Carrió\nCIENTÍFICOS\nJordi Armengol\nXavier Nicaise\nAbilio Calvo\nDaniel Noblom\n\nTECHNICAL TEAM\nGuión\nGuionista\nXavier Pijuan\nDirection\nDirector\nXavier Pijuan\nAyte.

            "description": "In an alternate 1930's Prohibition-era New York City, it's not liquor that is outlawed but the future production of highly sentient robots known as automatons. Automata follows former NYPD detective turned private eye Sam Regal and his incredibly smart automaton partner, Carl Swangee. Together, they work to solve the case and understand each other in this dystopian America.\n\n\"Automata\" Episode 2 by Van Alan\n\nSubscribe to the DUST Newsletter: https://bit.ly/signal_newsletter\n\n#DUST #scifi #shortfilm\n\nMore About Automata:\nPutting a science ﬁction twist on the classic hard-boiled detective drama, Automata explores a dystopian alternative version of Prohibition-era New York City, similarly shaped by moral panic even though the alcohol ﬂows freely here. In this universe, Prohibition doesn't ban drinking, but the further production of sapient androids that have become prevalent by the 1920s. As a result, the existing androids, called automatons, are shunned by society, relegated to an untouchable caste of servants despite their near-human thought capability, and are frequently subjected to hatred and violence. It's in this oppressive setting that human private detective Sam Regal (Basil Harris, \"Grimm\") and his automaton partner Carl Swangee (Doug Jones, The Shape of Water) work together to solve cases for both communities, learning to see humanity in one another while trying to prove that justice is still worth serving. \n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

            "description": "In an alternate 1930's Prohibition-era New York City, it's not liquor that is outlawed but the future production of highly sentient robots known as automatons. Automata follows former NYPD detective turned private eye Sam Regal and his incredibly smart automaton partner, Carl Swangee. Together, they work to solve the case and understand each other in this dystopian America.\n\n\"Automata\" Episode 2 by Van Alan\n\nSubscribe to the DUST Newsletter: https://bit.ly/signal_newsletter\n\n#DUST #scifi #shortfilm\n\nMore About Automata:\nPutting a science ﬁction twist on the classic hard-boiled detective drama, Automata explores a dystopian alternative version of Prohibition-era New York City, similarly shaped by moral panic even though the alcohol ﬂows freely here. In this universe, Prohibition doesn't ban drinking, but the further production of sapient androids that have become prevalent by the 1920s. As a result, the existing androids, called automatons, are shunned by society, relegated to an untouchable caste of servants despite their near-human thought capability, and are frequently subjected to hatred and violence. It's in this oppressive setting that human private detective Sam Regal (Basil Harris, \"Grimm\") and his automaton partner Carl Swangee (Doug Jones, The Shape of Water) work together to solve cases for both communities, learning to see humanity in one another while trying to prove that justice is still worth serving. \n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

            "description": "In an alternate 1930's Prohibition-era New York City, it's not liquor that is outlawed but the future production of highly sentient robots known as automatons. Automata follows former NYPD detective turned private eye Sam Regal and his incredibly smart automaton partner, Carl Swangee. Together, they work to solve the case and understand each other in this dystopian America.\n\n\"Automata\" Episode 1 by Van Alan\n\nSubscribe to the DUST Newsletter: https://bit.ly/signal_newsletter\n\n#DUST #scifi #shortfilm\n\nMore About Automata:\nPutting a science ﬁction twist on the classic hard-boiled detective drama, Automata explores a dystopian alternative version of Prohibition-era New York City, similarly shaped by moral panic even though the alcohol ﬂows freely here. In this universe, Prohibition doesn't ban drinking, but the further production of sapient androids that have become prevalent by the 1920s. As a result, the existing androids, called automatons, are shunned by society, relegated to an untouchable caste of servants despite their near-human thought capability, and are frequently subjected to hatred and violence. It's in this oppressive setting that human private detective Sam Regal (Basil Harris, \"Grimm\") and his automaton partner Carl Swangee (Doug Jones, The Shape of Water) work together to solve cases for both communities, learning to see humanity in one another while trying to prove that justice is still worth serving. \n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

            "description": "In an alternate 1930's Prohibition-era New York City, it's not liquor that is outlawed but the future production of highly sentient robots known as automatons. Automata follows former NYPD detective turned private eye Sam Regal and his incredibly smart automaton partner, Carl Swangee. Together, they work to solve the case and understand each other in this dystopian America.\n\nSubscribe to the DUST Newsletter: https://bit.ly/signal_newsletter\n\n#DUST #scifi #shortfilm\n\nMore About Automata:\nPutting a science ﬁction twist on the classic hard-boiled detective drama, Automata explores a dystopian alternative version of Prohibition-era New York City, similarly shaped by moral panic even though the alcohol ﬂows freely here. In this universe, Prohibition doesn't ban drinking, but the further production of sapient androids that have become prevalent by the 1920s. As a result, the existing androids, called automatons, are shunned by society, relegated to an untouchable caste of servants despite their near-human thought capability, and are frequently subjected to hatred and violence. It's in this oppressive setting that human private detective Sam Regal (Basil Harris, \"Grimm\") and his automaton partner Carl Swangee (Doug Jones, The Shape of Water) work together to solve cases for both communities, learning to see humanity in one another while trying to prove that justice is still worth serving. \n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

Once they unplug, they’re confused. Do they sympathize with the struggle one-another have faced or are they repelled by some of the actions that are the by-product of cataclysmic past trauma?\n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

One of the camping retreats where middle-class families take their summer vacation. Lit by a cold neon light, Mateo looks at himself in the mirror of the communal bathroom. Beneath the thin fabric of his shirt is a strange dark shape. Something is growing from his youthful skin. As he watches, it begins to grow, uncoiling and mutating. Colors swirl dimly in its surface. A young girl in a summer dress, Chloe, steps out of one of the bathroom stalls. Chloe’s eyeliner is smeared around her eyes. Her lip-gloss shines in the ﬂuorescent lights. They both are silent and still -- caught by surprise… \n\nGENERIQUE\n\nUn film produit par\nHEXAGONE\n\nProductrice\nSandrine SCHUMACHER\n\nÉcrit & réalisé par\nLaurent BARTHÉLÉMY\n\nDirectrice de production\nLéa MOREL\n\nCoordinateur de production\nClément GUILLOTON & Maëva TENNERONI\n\nDirectrice de casting\nEmma SKOWRONEK\n\n1er assistant à la réalisation\nMark ZARKA\n\n2nd assistant à la réalisation\nReuben BOCOBZA\n\nRégisseuse Générale\nAmandine LAURENT\n\nRepéreur\nGauthier RAVILY\n\nAssistant régisseur\nEmmanuel ESTEVES\n\nDirecteur de la Photographie\nBénoît SOLER\n\n1er assistant OPV\nPrune SAUNIER-DARDANT\n\n2nd assistant OPV\nSophie QUAGLINO\n\n3eme assistant OPV\nKevin ROSÉ\n\nChef Electricien\nThomas GARREAU\n\nChef machiniste\nThomas SPIRAL\n\nIngénieur du son\nJulien SENA\n\nStyliste\nMaud DUPUY\n\nAccessoire et maquillage SFX\nCamille BOUVET\n\nChef Maquilleuse-Coiffeuse\nEmma FRANCO\n\nEtalonnage\nFred SAVOIR pour Amazing Digital Studios\n\nMontage\nMaxime POZZI GARCIA pour FIRM\n\nEffets Spéciaux\n 8VFX \n\nMusique\nTURZI\n\nSound Design & Mix: \nYves ZARKA\n\nAVEC\n\nRod PARADOT\nDans le rôle de Mateo\n\nLula COTTON FRAPIER\nDans le rôle de Chloé\n\nJérôme LENOTRE\nDans le rôle du père de Mateo\n\nAuréa FERRIER\nDans le rôle de la petite sœur de Mateo\n\nLéa PERRIER\nDans le rôle d’amie de Chloé\n\nMarie-Jade DEBARD\nDans le rôle d’amie de Chloé\n\nMargaux LEBRUN\nDans le rôle d’amie de Chloé\n\nCandice MESSAOUDI\nDans le rôle d’amie de Chloé\n\nUn grand merci à la participation de :\nSolène, Cassandre, Lucas, Julien, Jérôme, Adriel, Kévin\n\nREMERCIEMENTS :\n\nÀ CAP JUNIOR :\nDavid MOUSSET , Nathanael GAYRAL, Etienne GRAPPERON\nPour le prêt des tentes, d’accessoires divers et le don de nourriture.\n\nCLUB DE FOOTBALL DE VALLON PONT D’ARC\nPrêt des t-shirts de football\n \nL’ARCHE DE NOÉ\nLocation de canöe-Kayak\n\nChristophe, Caroline, Auréa FERRIER et son petit frère. \n\nElie ATTIA pour son aide de Paris\n\nRESTAURANT DU VILLAGE\nThibault & ses filles\n\nCINEDA\nAlain Masseron\n\nMellie Arnaud\n\nLA TRIBUNE\nMichèle VOLLE\n\nDECORS :\n\nLA ROUVIERE\nEstelle, Gisèle, Didier, Marc, Marion, Léa, Marie-Jade, Margaux , Florian, Maxence, Clovis, Nath, Xavier, Antoine, Phil du camping d’à côté.\n\nCAMPING LE SOLEIL VIVARAIS YELLOH VILLAGE\nFlorian, Anne Sophie MIRABELLE, Sebastien, Paul, Johana et toute l’équipe du bar, des cuisines et de l’animation.\n\nLA FERME\nBenjamin Masseron\n\nISLA COOL DOUCE\nDanny\n\nBOIS DE PAIOLIVE\n\nUN GRAND MERCI À :\n\nVANTAGE\n\nA4 AUDIO\n\nPLANNING CAMERA\n\nCININTER\n\nCICAR\n\nCAR’GO\n\nMACWAY\n\nALDANE PRODUCTION\n\nSOTAVENTO PRODUCTION\n\nAPS\n\nFLAM&CO\n\nRUBINI\nOlivia Baup\n\nSABBAH COMMUNICATIONS\n\nFRANCE RADIO\n\nTOTEM STUDIO\n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

They looked more like monsters to me.\n\n\"Apocalypse Now Now\" by Michael Matthews\n\nSubscribe to the DUST Newsletter: https://bit.ly/signal_newsletter\n\n#DUST #scifi #shortfilm\n\nMore About Apocalypse Now Now:\nSnarky, monster-porn-dealing teen, Baxter Zevcenko, might be a serial killer. His girlfriend, Esme, is missing, and he’s the prime suspect. To clear his name, he’ll turn to Cape Town’s grizzliest, drunkest bounty hunter, Jackson ‘Jackie’ Ronin. Little does he know that Ronin is a supernatural bounty-hunter, and that he’s about to be dragged headlong into a deep, dark Cape Town underbelly full of monsters and myth, shadowy government forces, bloodthirsty crow-men and a conspiracy across time and space. But just how stable is Baxter? With every chance that it’s all in his head, it’s up to this mismatched pair to prevent the Apocalypse - quick. Well, quick-ish. \n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

They've secured a contract to harvest a large deposit of the elusive gems hidden in the depths of the moon's toxic forest. But there are others roving the wilderness and the job quickly devolves into a fight to survive. Forced to contend not only with the forest's other ruthless inhabitants, but with her own father's greed-addled judgment, the girl finds she must carve her own path to escape.\n\nSubscribe to the DUST Newsletter: https://bit.ly/signal_newsletter\n\n#DUST #scifi #shortfilm\n\nAvailable Now on digital and VOD platforms\nGoogle Play: http://bit.ly/Prospect-Google-Play \niTunes: http://apple.co/2qNYKUA \n\nStarring Sophie Thatcher, Pedro Pascal, Jay Duplass, Andre Royo, Sheila Vand, and Anwan Glover.\n\nWritten and Directed by Zeek Earl and Chris Caldwell.\n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

His social perception is his livelihood – so when mysterious and grotesque warts begin appearing on his body he resolves to remove and hide them from his devoted followers. But the malformities persist and Dorian grows increasingly paranoid as a result. What he doesn't realize is that the deformity is not a physical ailment, but a psychological one: He is suffering from Dysmorphia.\n\nFull Credits:\nCrew: \nDirectors: Phillip Vernon & Elijah Guess \nProducers: Phillip Vernon & Elijah Guess \nWriters: Phillip Vernon & Elijah Guess \nCinematographer: Elijah Guess \nEditor: Phillip Vernon \nSound Designer: Shaun Yee \nProduction Sound: Shaun Yee \nSFX Artist: Dre Lamparello \nMakeup Artist: Avary Mitchell \nColorist: Steven Wetrich \nTitle Design: Sadie Goff \nOriginal Music: Dead Recipe \nCast: \nDorian Dash: Joey De Felice \nKelly: Cameron Kelly \nMichell: Delayne Mitchell \nShaina: Chelsea Davis\n\nConnect with the filmmakers:\nFollow Elijah Guess on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/elijahguess/ \nFollow Phillip Vernon on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/phillthyphill/\n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

            "description": "Two students document the arrival of cute, cartoon aliens in Edinburgh, but after a year on Earth, the pair discover the true intention of the aliens visit.\n\n\"Toonocalypse\" by Owen Rixon\n\nSubscribe to the DUST Newsletter: https://bit.ly/signal_newsletter\n\n#DUST #scifi #shortfilm\n\nMore About Toonocalypse: \nToonocalypse follows students John (David Kaye) and Michael (Matt Martin) and their account of an alien invasion of Edinburgh. Through the lens of John’s hand-held camera, and over the course of a year, these cute, cartoon aliens, better known as “Toons”, become accustomed to and integrated into John and Michael’s lives and our society. John is far more laid-back and relishes the Toons’ arrival, seeing them as toys for him to play with. Michael on the other hand is far more sceptical and wary of them, unwilling to let them into his house and life. Over the year, Michael warms to the Toons and eventually sees them as friends as opposed to John who still sees them as dispensable play-things. On the ﬁrst anniversary of the Toons’ arrival on Earth the Toons which were so cute and cuddly before suddenly become larger and more aggressive. In their attempt to escape danger, John and Michael come across Charles (James Carney), a zoology student who has a theory as to what is happening to the Toons. Now armed with the information which could save their lives, John and Michael attempt to escape the streets of Edinburgh before falling victim to the Toons true intentions.\n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

The only problem being, it has been put on a list of censored books.\n\n\"The Giraffe Who Knew Too Much\" by Eric Tosstorff\n\nSubscribe to the DUST Newsletter: https://bit.ly/signal_newsletter\n\n#DUST #scifi #shortfilm\n\nMore About The Giraffe Who Knew Too Much: \nThe story plays out in a not-so-distant future where corporations, in conjunction with the government, decide what should be said, read, and published throughout all media. A small 5 year-old boy named Tom, who lives with his single mother, Jill, in New York, has to give up his favorite book; \"The Giraffe That Knew Too Much\"-- because it got put on a list of censored books. Not understanding what is going on around him, Tom just wants to hold on to his favorite book, while his mother doesn't want to upset the higher powers. The story is an innocent look at censorship through the eyes of a child. 2013 - Ofﬁcial Selection The London Internation Festival Of Science Fiction and Fantastic Film 2013 - Ofﬁcial Selection NY Shorts Fest\n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

            "description": "In a not so distant future, humans must take pharmaceuticals to feel any emotion at all. This is the story about two people who have been prescribed to take the next step in their relationship. \n\nSubscribe to the DUST Newsletter: https://bit.ly/signal_newsletter\n\n\"Capsules\" by Burton Chaikin\n\n#DUST #scifi #shortfilm\n\nMore About Capsules: \nIn a not so distant future, humans must take pharmaceuticals to feel any emotion at all. Every morning, individuals wake up and begin their days by scanning their ﬁngerprint in order to accurately measure the necessary personalized dosage levels of happiness, courage, anxiety, fear, motivation, and so on. We ﬁnd ourselves with Claire and Owen, a seemingly happy couple who want to take the next step in their relationship by prescribing themselves the ultimate emotion: Love. In this dystopian future, partners must have their compatibility assessed in order to conﬁrm that the prescriptions will work to their fullest potential. At the start, the pills work exactly as expected for Claire and Owen—they couldn’t be more in love with each other. But as their relationship advances, Claire begins to realize the effects are fading for her alone. She attempts to consume more and more of this powerful emotion, but is only becoming less and less affected by her partner. Owen, meanwhile, could not be more in love. She goes back to the pharmacy to ask what could be going wrong, but to no avail. When she ultimately decides to stop taking the pills, Owen--so overwhelmed by his unreciprocated love--tries to force her to do so. She ﬁghts back, and in doing so, gains a new understanding of the power of love—a power that existed long before it was packaged into capsules.\n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

            "description": "Set amidst the euphoric madness of a summer music festival, Robot & Scarecrow is a uniquely modern fairytale about love. When a robot pop princess ﬂees her keeper she runs straight into the arms of a lonely scarecrow desperate for adventure. They spend an incredible night together, caught in a heady vortex of music and magic.\n\n\"Robot & Scarecrow\" by Kibwe Tavares\n\nSubscribe to the DUST Newsletter: https://bit.ly/signal_newsletter\n\n#DUST #scifi #shortfilm\n\nMore About Robot & Scarecrow: \nPerched on a hill overlooking a music festival, our lonely Scarecrow is being tortured by crows. As he takes in the distant festival, it pushes him to change his fate. Filled with renewed strength, Scarecrow manages to uproot himself and sets off to experience ﬁrst-hand what he has listened to every summer for years. What he ﬁnds at the festival, however, is far beyond what he expected. \n\nBackstage, we meet a lonely Robot pop princess with a dying battery cell. Knowing this is her last night of existence before being powered down, she escapes into the audience after her performance, hoping to spend her last few hours living a real life. \n\nRobot and Scarecrow, two lost and lonely souls in the middle of the beautiful chaos, stumble upon each other. They spend one glorious night together, exploring everything the festival has to offer, whilst quickly falling in love. \n\nBy the time the dawn comes around they have had the perfect twenty-four hour party experience. But what Scarecrow doesn’t realise is that his new love’s battery is dying and as the sun is coming up, her life is fading fast. \n\nMaybe nothing this good can last forever... right?\n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

            "description": "While on the moon a curious astronaut inadvertently strokes his way into the heart of an extraterrestrial who has a very special way of returning the affection.\n\n\"Astroknot\" by Joel Erkkinen\n\nSubscribe to the DUST Newsletter: https://bit.ly/signal_newsletter\n\n#DUST #scifi #shortfilm\n\nMore About Astroknot: \nAfter landing on the moon, an astronaut discovers a curious green and sparkly being with a single red eye. The intrigued astronaut inspects the properties of the extraterrestrial in a very non-scientific manner of poking, slapping, and tickling, the being seems to react. Suddenly the alien stiffens and grows to look the man right in his space mask.\nUnder the menacing gaze of the alien, the spaceman is transfixed. With a swift slap the being dispatches its eye onto the visor of the astronaut. Frozen in place as the alien retracts, the astronaut attempts to inspect the new glowing red eye placed upon is mask.\nJust as he is about to touch the red orb his mask explodes into a field of sparkles. He has been transformed into an identical green alien partner. As our lover departs in a \"come hither\" dash, the newly formed green alien squeezes out of the space suit and swiftly follows across the lunar surface.\nThe dust settles on the moon after the lovers leave. Emerging in front of the camera is another green alien with a red eye. Gazing into our soul it lunges at the audience ending in a shower of hearts and fireworks.\nWe may think this is the end of love in space.

While many herald this as a new age of human evolution and culture, for those who do not have this gift, this new world is a dark place. The non-telepathic have become the new under-class, with new laws and social change making them less than human.\n\nAlina is a young woman who has not developed telepathic abilities. Under the new 'Reclamation' laws, Alina is case managed by a telepathic social worker named Ash. Through their interview, we learn Alina's story and the discrimination she has faced through her life.\n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

            "description": "In an undefined future where mankind have voluntarily abandoned technology to live back in nomadism, an old man initiates a kid to the reasons of humanity’s return to nature. Apparently teleportation had something to do with it. \n\n\"Sand Castle\" by Alessandro Ubaldi\n\nSubscribe to the DUST Newsletter: https://bit.ly/signal_newsletter\n\n#DUST #scifi #shortfilm\n\nMore About Sand Castle: \nThe elderly explains how mankind’s ancient dream of progress has brought to a limit-breaking society always in search for further steps to overcome. That was what happened in mobility, until the invention of human teleportation. This would have changed the game and from that point something mutated forever. With the encounter of an abandoned tele-port the wiseman reveals the rest of the story. In doing this he introduces his young companion to a fundamental question about our own species.\n\nCredits:\n\nStephen M. Gilbert as Hob, the wise man\nTristan Heers as Allan, the youngster\n\nDirected and edited by Alessandro Ubaldi\nWritten and Produced by Augusto Girolimetti\nAssistant Director: Iva Fischer\nCinematographer: Serjosha J.

You just wait.\n\n\"The Time Agent\" by Jude Chun\n\nThe Time Agent (dir. by Jude Chun) is on its way to become a feature length sci-fi action film, with creative partners Derek Kolstad (writer of JOHN WICK franchise) and John Davis (produced PREDATOR franchise) and Black Label Media (produced SICARIO and LA LA LAND).\n\nSubscribe to the DUST Newsletter: https://bit.ly/signal_newsletter\n\n#DUST #scifi #shortfilm\n\nMore About The Time Agent: \nAn Agent from the future comes to the past to prevent crimes. The only way for him to return to the future is simply to wait. During this time, he must live in complete isolation.

He begins scrolling through typical content; food posts, selfies, puppy videos… This is where the perspective shifts.

The newspapers all said she was abducted. \n\nThe trauma of that event haunts Terri to this very day. But not because her sister's gone. No, she's happy about that. She's been tormented for all these long years because Terri didn't get to go with her. She didn't get to go back home - to their real home - on another planet. \n\nOf course no one believed her. Not back then and not now. None of her family. None of her doctors (and there’s been a lot them). Not even her husband. \n\nAnd just today, as she continues searching the skies as an amateur astronomer, she receives a signal. A cosmic message of sorts. One she believes is from her sister and her home planet. \n\nIt’s happened before though. Her family calls them “episodes”. But this time she keeps it a secret. \n\nMaybe she really is crazy after all. \n\nOr maybe no one can tell her it’s not true. No one can keep her from devising a plan. And no one can stop her from going back home.\n\nCredits:\nPRINCIPAL CAST:\nTerry & Twin Sister - Melanie Merkosky\nHusband - Josh Roberts\n\nPRINCIPAL CREW:\nWriter/director/editor - Blake Calhoun\nProducers - Blake Calhoun & Adam Donaghey\nCo-producer - Joey Stewart\nProduction designer - Tom Walker\nCamera - Cliff Richhart\nLighting - Paul Howard\nOriginal Score - Damon Criswell\nMake-up - Katherine Erenzo\nVFX Artist - Cliff Richhart\n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

Felix is an introverted pot dealer living alone in The Goodall Wooten; a decaying, claustrophobic high-rise. Following a breakup, Felix becomes addicted to a virtual reality avatar of his ex-girlfriend Dani, who has moved just down the hall. While the world carries on around him, Felix feels trapped in his own mind, all while the building mysteriously refuses to let him leave.\n\nFull Credits:\n\nWritten and Directed by\nDavid Howe\n\nStarring\nWyatt Tall\n\nFeaturing\nBloom Davis\nBrian Beavers\nDavid Howe\nAndrew Ryder\nGideon De Villiers\nLeslie Curtice\nNate Bell\nJeremy Franklin\nRobert Traylor\nLauren Williams\nAmir Zamen\n\nDirector of Photography\nGideon De Villiers\n\nFirst Assistant Camera\nJustin Howe\n\nSound Recording and Mixing\nSchuyler Hupp\n\nSet Design and Prop Master\nNate Bell\n\nProduction Assistant\nLeslie Curtice\n\nEditor\nDavid Howe\n\nOriginal Score\nSamuel Green\n\nColorist\nJustin Howe\n\nSound Design\nDavid Howe and Schuyler Hupp\n\nVisual Effects\nTravis Benn\nAdditional Dialogue Recording\nRoxy Castillo\n\nStory Consultant\nChristina Parrish\n\nArtwork by\nPayton Lower\n\nExecutive Producer\nDavid Bukstein\n\nProduced by\nDavid Howe and Gideon De Villiers\n\nAssociate Producers\nRay Prunty\nMichael Howe\nJoe Bates\nCharles Martin\n\nMusic\n“Les Folies Francaises”\nPerformed by Matmos\nWritten by Francois Couperin\n\n“Etude, Op. 25, No. 1”\nPerformed by Vladimir Horowitz\nWritten by Frederick Chopin\n\nSpecial Thanks\nAlex Ingraham Lee Eddy Regina Melo\nArielle Laguette Sylvia Payne Sofia Abreu\nBenjamin Schalk Amir Zamen Samantha Stepp\nGramps The Vamp Anna Whitney Jordan Garcia\nJill Bostur Baylor Estes Mark Nelson\nJono Foley Caitlin Lundin Aaron Walther\nJulie Swec Clark Reed Sammi Frye\nKayce Kuntz Daniella Mason Sampson Simpson\nLeif Steenson Evan Smith Erin Michelle Allen\nRavi Morbia Jacob Villanueva Mehgan Hart\nKorey Pereira Jeff Whitaker Cassie Gerber\nMonica Kelly Jennifer Pelzer Julian Ludwig\nRobert Segovia Korey Conley Travis Hicks\nSteph Beasley Yamina Khouane Kavid Singh\nMike & Julie Howe Lindsey Moringy Mark Carpenter\nBecky Rodriguez Graham Duncan Houndstooth Studio\nThe New Movement Roxanne Wisniewski Joy Gohring\nBao Truong Harrison Atkins Sean Minns\nThe Goodall Wooten Chloe Lepaule Alexander Boulgakov\n\nFilmed on location in\nAustin, Texas\n\n2016 Monolith Fiji Productions\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDCzAWhOyfw\n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

A military-led search for these unwitting suicide bombers begins, sending a terrified machine woman and her human partner on the run.\n\n\"Seam\" by Rajeev Dassani and Elan Dassani\n\nSubscribe to the DUST Newsletter: https://bit.ly/signal_newsletter\n\n#DUST #scifi #shortfilm\n\nMore About Seam: \nAn Arab refugee woman tries to find her way to safety in the aftermath of a massive war. That war was with our Machine Creations. She discovers that she is a suicide sleeper bomb, embedded in the human population years ago, and has lived without knowledge of what she actually is. Her soldier husband must now help her get to the Machine Homeland, deep within the Arabian desert, before its too late, hunted by human forces who believe she is a spy bringing vital information to the enemy.\n\nFor full credits go here: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt7267706/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast\n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

Donny takes the stage to dramatically tell his story of how he came to have real human emotions. His anecdotes are portrayed with highlights from his world-spanning adventures that have shaped who he has become. As the ceremony goes on, Donny’s vision becomes grander, more ambitious and potentially concerning. Will Donny be able to freely pursue his dream of helping all over the world—or will mankind’s darker, paranoid instincts intervene before Donny achieves ultimate, worldwide control. \n\nConnect with Mackenzie Sheppard:\nFollow Mackenzie Sheppard on Vimeo: https://vimeo.com/mackenziesheppard\n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

She has stolen food from the village people, but the shepherd, named Isaac, takes it from her, determined to teach her a lesson. She ends up learning more than he expects, as she uncovers the true nature of him and his odd sheep; that he is an intergalactic defender of the planet, and the sheep are former alien invaders. When suddenly a new invader crash lands in the mountains, Asmita is put to the test: does she have what it takes to become like Issac - intergalactic protector of the planet - or is she forever doomed to the streets? After a short battle, where Isaac is loosing the battle to the invader, Asmita steps in and overpowers the alien. She is surprised to find that the shepherds staff can turn aliens into sheep. Isaac is surprised too, that Asmita was able to help him out. As a reward she gets to stay with him and join the ranks as protector of planet earth.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/NkmEuk4WEc8\n\nFull Credits:\nDirectors:\nJohn Henrik Muller\nLasse Rützou Bruntse\n\nAnimators:\nSøren Krøjgaard (Lead animator)\nAnne Hoberg Overgaard ( + Character designer)\nSabine Lynderup Nielsen\nPernille Kjær\nChristina Bøjesen\nLasse Rützou Bruntse\n\nBackground artist:\nBenjamin Bach Nielsen (+ art director)\nEmilie Stabell (+ Editor)\nBjørn Højlund\nJohn Henrik Muller\n\nProducer:\nMichelle Ann Nardone, Anja Perl, Morten Thorning\n\nConnect with The Shepherd:\nWebsite: http://shepherdfilm.tumblr.com/film\n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

Ted's personal endeavor is taking away from his work with Alzheimer's patients at Janus Labs and his lab partner, Shea Rose, is getting fed up with his tardiness and lack of focus. That is, until, a mysterious visitor named Obee changes Ted's life for good.\n\nMemoir is a short proof-of-concept for a feature film of the same title. With the short film, it was our goal to capture the tone and essence of the feature, without taking any scenes directly from the feature script.\n\nConnect with the filmmakers:\nWebsite: http://www.bespokeworksllc.com\nFollow Molto Bella on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/moltobellafilm/\nFollow Alexander Jeffery on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/user/andreavonkampen/videos\n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

Unfortunately, the ship's captain, Rishi, passes away after an adverse reaction to the hyper-sleep. Now it's up to the two remaining astronauts, Pankaj and Naaz, to come together and land the vessel in his memory.\n\nTo complicate things, India's mission control requires them to jettison the corpse in order to avoid bringing biological contaminates to the new planet. But Naaz, who has fallen in love with Rishi, refuses to let this happen. While Pankaj finds her actions weak and in direct compromise of the mission, Naaz must prove that strength comes from a place that is elevated far above scientific protocol—and is what makes us human in this great expanse called the cosmos.\n\nFor a full list of credits go here:\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt3205084/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast\n\nConnect with Faroukh Virani:\nWebsite: http://indiaindependentfilms.com/2013/05/31/confessions-from-brown-hollywood-with-faroukh-virani-director-of-the-upcoming-film-vimana/\nWebsite: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3205084/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast\n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

With complimentary microwave dinners, unlimited thirst-quenching soda, and over five television channels to choose from, who could ask for anything more? But when his cyborg caretakers decide to introduce a female into the exhibit, his world changes forever. As he tries to relate to Caz, a living, breathing woman, Jim discovers that maybe his sheltered life isn’t all it’s cracked up to be. After a few chaotic days together, they decide that Caz is going to leave on her own. After she escapes, a lonely Jim is forced to decide whether he has the courage to follow her and face the outside world.\n\nFor a full list of credits go here: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1773494/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast\n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

He has been marooned on a desolate planet where he struggles to utilize his weak and failing satellite link to attempt daily distress beacons for rescue. But with little power available, he is unable to get just enough solar power to send that one frequency “S.O.S”.\n\nL.O.I.D., a two-bit cargo droid en route to his galactic destination is in a suspended state of consciousness, drifting through space in his cargo vessel the “Lucky Strike”. Through fate or just unfortunate circumstance, L.O.I.D's ship collides with a piece of space debris and is woken by the chaos of his ship speeding through space uncontrollably towards Snibb's lone planet.\nWith L.O.I.D's ship crash landing on Snibb's planet, these two characters are able to benefit from each other through their new friendship and attempt to find a solution off this isolated world.\n\nFull Credits:\nDirector - Andy Lefton\nAll animation, FX, compositing, editing - Andy Lefton\nSound Design - Lister Rossel\nMusic - Thomas J Peters\nMusic - Jeff Butta\n\nConnect with Andy Lefton:\nWebsite: http://www.andylefton.com/\nFollow Andy Lefton on Vimeo: https://vimeo.com/183908568\n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

The film is a tribute to science fiction films of my youth and to those real life pioneers that inspire it. A solo project completed in six weeks (in my spare time) and produced entirely in Unreal Engine 4.\n\nMusic by Boomopera\n\nFor more about the director go here:\nWebsite: https://www.robmclellandirector.com/\n\nCheck out Rob's other films on DUST:\nAbe: https://youtu.be/t_t6aoGIQGk\nAlways the Sun: https://youtu.be/NjyqUz_N8zA\n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

            "description": "We need Afrofuturism; not as a box to put people in, but as a lens with which to change the way we see the future. It’s a future where black people are not only included, but are in control of their own destinies.\n\nSubscribe to the DUST Newsletter: https://bit.ly/signal_newsletter\n\n#DUST #scifi #shortfilm\n\nMore About Afrofuturism: \nAfrofuturism is not a sub-genre. For some, like Sun Ra, Afrofuturism (though the term was not coined until after Sun Ra passed away) is a form of escapism; a reprieve from violent systems of segregation and white supremacy. For others, Afrofuturism is a celebration of black innovation; filmmaker and author Ytasha Womack describes Afrofuturism as, “The intersection between black culture, technology, liberation, and the imagination, with some mysticism thrown in, too.” For some it is highly spiritual. Above all else, it is an ambitious vision of the future and mankind’s place in it that is continually informed by black culture and history.\n\nWhat kind of message is sent when mass audiences are presented with visions of the future that do not include people of color? Since Hollywood has historically excluded black characters from leading roles in science fiction films, black people have had to envision and ultimately create space for themselves above and beyond the Earth’s atmosphere. In DUST’s original series, we celebrate a handful of those people, and encourage you to dive deeper into the Afrofuture.\n\nWe present to you the stories of:\n- Sun Ra: Considered the forefather of Afrofuturism.\n- Uhura: One of the lieutenants on Star Trek’s Starship Enterprise. Portrayed by Nichelle Nichols in the original series, she counted Martin Luther King as one of her biggest fans.\n- George Clinton: Whose brand of funk was filled with cosmic imagery.\n- Jimi Hendrix: Who often imagined himself as an alien.\n- Missy Elliott: Who popularized the pairing of science-fiction and hip-hop.\n\n(If Applicable): Credits + Any other blurbs such as directors statment, time stamp list etc \n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

Simultaneous to the superpower's struggle, a wealthy eccentric by the name of Arthur Whitman set out to search for his own stellar glory. His self-financed voyage would see him try to break the record for the longest single-manned space mission, and remain in orbit for 1 week.\n\nThis is a story of one man's struggle against the forces of nature, and the more powerful forces that lay within his own psyche.\n\nOriginally released June 19th, 2012 to commemorate the 49th anniversary of the longest solo space flight in history. The record was set by Valery Bykovsky with a total flight time of 4 days and 23 hours.\n\nCREDITS:\nDirected by John Merizalde (johnmerizalde.com)\nProduced by Takashi Doscher (takashidoscher.com)\nCinematography by David Torcivia (davidtorcivia.com)\nStarring: Mark Ashworth\n\nFull Credits: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2667926/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast\n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

Her short film “So You’ve Grown Attached” was a national finalist for the Student Academy Award, won Best Narrative Short at San Francisco International Film Festival, and was nationally broadcast on PBS. She’s currently developing her first feature film and also in production on an animated short, Welcome to Doozy, with the Sony Animation and Frederator Go!Cartoon incubator. Kate spent the first decade of her life bouncing between the sleepy suburbs of California and the hectic city of Hong Kong. In her teenage years, she was inspired by Dana Scully from The X-Files to become a medical examiner so she shadowed local CSI officers and morticians to\nprep herself for a gory future. All that changed when she took her first film class at UC San Diego, and consequently broke her mother’s heart by deciding to pursue a career in the arts. Kate earned an MFA from NYU’s prestigious film program where she won awards from the\nHollywood Foreign Press Association and National Board of Review for her work. Her mom has since forgiven her.\n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

            "description": "Fifteen years later, Jacob Reiss, a disillusioned IPMA veteran, has a fateful encounter with a young cartel prostitute. A meeting that forces him to confront a dark chapter from his past in order to save them both from a bleak future in one final, violent shot at redemption.\n\n\"The Leap\" by Karel van Bellingen\n\nSubscribe to the DUST Newsletter: https://bit.ly/signal_newsletter\n\n#DUST #scifi #shortfilm\n\nMore About The Leap: \nIn 2069, New Earth is declared open for civilian migration, a decade after its discovery. As tales of wonder and opportunity reach the Old World, taking ‘the leap’ becomes the dream of millions. Unable to afford the journey, many of the less fortunate risk their lives being smuggled aboard cargo ships. The inter-planetary Migration Administration, or IPMA, deals with human trafficking on a biblical scale.\n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

            "description": "In the canon of popular black musicians who have written songs about space, there are none who shook up the mainstream nearly as much as Jimi Hendrix. Like Sun Ra before him, Hendrix wrote songs about interstellar travel, even including alien characters in songs like “Up From The Skies” and “Third Stone From The Sun”, which was inspired by George R Stewart’s post-apocalyptic science fiction novel, Earth Abides. But Hendrix wouldn’t be able to bring his message to the masses until he traveled to England and battled God himself, Eric Clapton (then playing in a supergroup called Cream). In this episode of Afrofuturism, DUST presents the animated story of that fateful night. Originally intended to be a friendly jam session between God (Clapton) and one of his biggest fans, the then unknown Hendrix, Clapton walked off-stage in the middle of Hendrix’s solo, stunned by the no-name’s guitar wizardry. Hendrix’s performance that night forged a brotherhood with Clapton and is just one of many such stories of his mind-blowing performances that would carve out his place in rock n’ roll history as the unmatched greatest guitarist of all-time (according to Rolling Stone). Hendrix’s infatuation with science fiction, and his commitment to technological (and psychedelic) experimentation, pushed him to make his guitar sound like anything but, and has inspired artists of many genres to embrace their individuality ever since.\n\nSubscribe to the DUST Newsletter: https://bit.ly/signal_newsletter\n\n#DUST #scifi #shortfilm\n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

Uhura was played by Nichelle Nichols in the original series, and first appeared in 1966. In reality, it would take nearly 30 years for a black woman to make it to space – NASA astronaut Mae Jemison, in 1992.\n \nIn episode two of DUST’s Afrofuturism series, Uhura beams up Sun Ra, Martin Luther King, and the aforementioned Jemison, as narrator Little Simz tells us the true story of how King convinced Nichelle Nichols to stay on the show after the first season. Nichols would go on to appear in 66 episodes. \n\nSubscribe and watch more sci-fi shorts on DUST: http://bit.ly/2aqc5vh\nThanks for checking out the second episode of our 5 part original series Afrofuturism: Ep 2 Uhura.\n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

A future where black people are in control of their own destinies.\n\nSubscribe to the DUST Newsletter: https://bit.ly/signal_newsletter\n\n#DUST #scifi #shortfilm\n\nMore About Afrofuturism: \nWelcome to the first video in our 5 part original series Afrofuturism: Ep 1 Sun Ra.\n\nAfrofuturism is not a sub-genre. For some, like Sun Ra, Afrofuturism (though the term was not coined until after Sun Ra passed away) is a form of escapism; a reprieve from violent systems of segregation and white supremacy. For others, Afrofuturism is a celebration of black innovation; filmmaker and author Ytasha Womack describes Afrofuturism as, “The intersection between black culture, technology, liberation, and the imagination, with some mysticism thrown in, too.” For some it is highly spiritual. Above all else, it is an ambitious vision of the future and mankind's place in it that is continually informed by black culture and history.\n \nWhat kind of message is sent when mass audiences are presented with visions of the future that do not include people of color? Since Hollywood has historically excluded black characters from leading roles in science fiction films, black people have had to envision and ultimately create space for themselves above and beyond the Earth's atmosphere. In DUST’s original series, we celebrate a handful of those people, and encourage you to dive deeper into the Afrofuture.\n\nWe present to you the stories of:\n- Sun Ra: Considered the forefather of Afrofuturism.\n- Uhura: One of the lieutenants on Star Trek’s Starship Enterprise. Portrayed by Nichelle Nichols in the original series, she counted Martin Luther King as one of her biggest fans.\n- George Clinton: Whose brand of funk was filled with cosmic imagery.\n- Jimi Hendrix: Who often imagined himself as an alien.\n- Missy Elliott: Who popularized the pairing of science-fiction and hip-hop.\n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology. From timeless classics to cutting-edge movies, series, short films, and podcasts, DUST acquires, produces and distributes all content types.\n\nConnect with DUST\nWebsite: http://www.watchdust.com\nSign-up for DUST newsletter: http://eepurl.com/b_SKAz\nWatch DUST on your TV: Available on Roku, Samsung TV, Apple TV, Android TV...and more\nWatch more on YouTube: http://bit.ly/2amTSen\nFollow Us on Facebook: http://bit.ly/2aqYgtZ\nFollow Us on Instagram: http://bit.ly/2amAhRt\n\nListen to the DUST podcast:\nApple: http://bit.ly/DUST-Audio\nSpotify: http://bit.ly/DUST-Spotify\nStitcher: http://bit.ly/DUST-Stitcher\nCastbox: http://bit.ly/DUST-Castbox \niHeart: http://bit.ly/DUST-iHeart\n\nAbout Gunpowder + Sky:\nCreating content that resonates and impacts pop culture conversation, by empowering creators to take risks and experiment relentlessly in the pursuit of novel stories and formats.\n\nSci-Fi Short Documentary “Afrofuturism” Sun Ra Part 1 | Presented by DUST\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watchdust",

A late devoted scientist of these life forms has passed his life’s work on to his daughter, along with one part of his most prized catch. The other part, a mystical electric fish, has eluded him his entire life. An opportune discovery of this rare creature by a human inhabitant instigates an unusual mating ceremony, spawning a surge of life that traverses the gap between this life and the next. \n\nConnect with Luke Saunders:\nWebsite: http://www.lukesaundersdesign.com\nFollow on Vimeo:http:/www.vimeo.com/user4344858\n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

            "description": "In a sparse post-apocalyptic world a man's grief leads him on a path towards danger and disappointment.\n\n\"Where the Shadows Fall\" a film by Kate Phillips \n\nSubscribe to the DUST Newsletter: https://bit.ly/signal_newsletter\n\n#DUST #scifi #shortfilm\n\nMore About Where the Shadows Fall:\nThe world is dead. Its only inhabitants are loners and wanderers, people whose purposes in life remain unfulfilled. They linger on in an empty and bleak world. Some embrace the anarchy, while others continue to seek resolution and meaning. The Man is one of these. His search is for his family, a wife and son he lost so long ago that he no longer remembers the circumstances of their disappearance. All he knows is that he must find them, no matter the cost. It is the sole reason for his survival. When he comes upon a weird carnival of wandering strangers, he stops looking only for a place to rest and continue on his way. But then the strangers put on a show for their new guest, and the Man sees someone very familiar… Has he finally found what he seeks? Or is he so accustomed to self-deception that he can no longer recognize the face of the woman he once loved?\n\nConnect with Kate Phillips:\nWebsite: http://www.krphillips.com\n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

Written, shot, edited and scored in less than 48 hours.The filmmakers were given a random title (\"FALLING APART\"), a random line of dialogue (\"Fame is fleeting, baby, but legends live forever\") and a random prop/action (A mug of steaming liquid - a character sniffs the hot liquid and pours it away), and then had 48 hours to write a script with those elements, shoot it, edit it, grade it, score it, sound design it, export it and deliver it in person at the London BFI.

As this darkly atmospheric short progresses, this man and his dog are paid by a visit by unwelcome extraterrestrial guests. The encounter is sudden and terrifying. When the man comes to, he is unnerved by the footage captured by his phone.\n\n\"9 MINUTES\" by P.J.

Watch the short for yourself to find out what happened.\n\nDust loves the director’s resourceful use of one location, one actor, spare CGI, and patient suspense building.

            "description": "Earth as we know and love it may become a thing of the past.\n\n‘Telescope’ - by Collin Davis & Matt Litwiller (presented in 4k)\n\nSubscribe to the DUST Newsletter: https://bit.ly/signal_newsletter\n\n#DUST #scifi #shortfilm\n\nMore About Telescope:\nThat’s the starting premise of Collin Davis’s “Telescope.” This thoughtfully crafted short film follows a brave cosmic archaeologist as he travels back in time to capture photos of the once vibrant planet. As he travels further back in time, we learn that the galaxy and time he came from has a lifeless Earth with no organic life left on its surface. It’s hard to finish the film without feeling nostalgia for an Earth that is being taken for granted.\n \nDust loves this short film for its obvious environmental overtures but especially for its longing for a home that was but no longer is. A fun fact is that this film’s lead VFX artist is none other than Wes Ball, the acclaimed director of Maze Runner and short film Ruin.\n\nCollin Davis’s heartfelt film is worth watching more than once and taking to both head and heart.\n\nOfficial filmmaker site: http://pqdavis.com \n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

            "description": "R’Ha, directed by Kaleb Lechowski, is a fight for survival in a solar system where no one can be trusted. A civil war started by subversives they could have never seen coming. A group of fighters, relentless in their quest to protect their planets will do everything in their power to emerge the victorious underdog against an enemy that appears to always be two steps ahead. \n\nThis short leaves you on edge as the future of the guardians of space grows dim in the afterburner of the spacecraft that may lead their enemy right to them. The subtle ending shows a scene so seemingly benign it’ll hit you even harder when you realize the implications of it. \n\nSubscribe to the DUST Newsletter: https://bit.ly/signal_newsletter\n\n#DUST #scifi #shortfilm\n\nConnect with Kaleb Lechowski:\nWebsite: http://kaleblechowski.tumblr.com \n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

Our team calls this short required viewing for its dramatic and prescient message about the state of our justice system.\n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

What should have been a simple and violent extermination of artificial life proves harder when a captured robot demonstrates that the human aggressors are biting off more than they can chew.\n\nOur team loves the short for its impressive visual effects and character driven story. The late Star Trek actor Anton Yelchin delivers an especially strong performance that gets viewers to sympathize with the plight of a creation that is no longer wanted by its creator.\n\nConnect with David Karlak:\nWebsite: http://www.davidkarlak.com \n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

Our team calls this short required viewing for its dramatic and prescient message about the state of our justice system.\n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

The tension between the pessimistic protagonist and the liaison of the secret society comes to a head in a riveting twist.\n\nThe Candidate’s dark narrative is a dead ringer for “American Psycho” and would makes its predecessor proud. 20 minutes is longer than most short films run for but our team promises that after the short’s thrilling opening scene, you won’t be able to stop watching.\n\nConnect with David Karlak:\nWebsite: http://www.davidkarlak.com \n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.
